   <title type="text">Information Fluency Workshop: Center for Hellenic Studies</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://classicslibrarian.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/information-fluency-workshop-center-for-hellenic-studies/">Information Fluency Workshop: Center for Hellenic&nbsp;Studies</a><br />By Phoebe Acheson in <a href="http://classicslibrarian.wordpress.com/" id="infinity-blog-title" rel="home" title="Scroll back to top">Becoming a Classics Librarian     </a> <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">In July I had the privilege of spending 10 days teaching a workshop on information fluency in classical studies at the&nbsp;<a href="http://chs.harvard.edu/">Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington DC</a>.&nbsp;  It was an incredible luxury to explore a topic in such depth, when in  the past I have had at most an hour and a half to reach a group of  students! I am very grateful to <a href="http://www.rhodes.edu/grs/21207_21210.asp">Kenny Morrell</a>,  who invited me to teach this class; Lanah Koelle, our program  coordinator/librarian who contributed her expertise at every stage;  Allie Marby, CHS’s summer interns, and librarians Temple Wright and  Erika Bainbridge, who attended sessions and supported us at CHS,  especially in the <a href="http://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=ArticleWrapper&amp;bdc=12&amp;mn=1228">library</a>;  and most especially the workshop students, who gracefully accepted  their role as guinea pigs and taught me a great deal.&nbsp; The students were  a mixture on American undergraduates and Greek professionals in  education and information fields; each brought an inquisitive spirit and  their collective hard work and openness to sharing and new ideas was a  major factor in the success of the workshop. Thank you!</span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">As a group we assembled some resources that others who are interested in this topic may find useful.&nbsp; The first is a <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/chs_information_fluency/items">Zotero group library with folders that list the session topics</a>.  Each folder’s contents include citations for assigned readings for the  session (usually fairly short, web-based readings) and citations for  information resources we discussed during the session.</span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The students were asked to complete two assignments.&nbsp; The first, the  development of an annotated bibliography, is available as a Google  document: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cXaPqTDdOUIzI6E26SZiOFjb7a7BMzczWOfh8qXVSJc/" target="_blank" title="Open this link in a new window">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cXaPqTDdOUIzI6E26SZiOFjb7a7BMzczWOfh8qXVSJc/</a>. The second, a WordPress Research Guide, is also described in a Google document (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O3Rm8yXGlhIRPJh3PrDiMgiAgH0LiHhC44mSvq_9QNk/" target="_blank" title="Open this link in a new window">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O3Rm8yXGlhIRPJh3PrDiMgiAgH0LiHhC44mSvq_9QNk/</a>) and <a href="http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/chs-library/">the guide itself</a> is available via the CHS’s website.&nbsp; The guide should be viewed as a  work in progress; we began a project that we hope to flesh out with the  participants of future workshops in years to come. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Librarians and scholars interested in libraries and archives in Greece will be delighted by <a href="http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/chs-library/2013/07/17/maria-s-searching/">Maria Konstantopoulou’s entry on this topic</a>; Latin teachers can find many fun texts to use with beginning students in <a href="http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/chs-library/2013/07/15/scripta-georgii/">George Trapalis’ entry</a>; <a href="http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/chs-library/2013/07/18/society-and-culture-useful-resources-hellenic-studies/">Matina Goga has assembled a list of valuable links</a> for the study of Greek society and culture; <a href="http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/chs-library/2013/07/17/ancient-roman-society-and-culture-research-tools/">Brittany Profitt has done the same</a> for Roman society and culture; teachers of Greek might want to think about using <a href="http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/chs-library/2013/07/15/tylers-post/">Tyler Verity’s entry on precisely defining words</a> for a classroom exercise; <a href="http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/chs-library/2013/07/15/how-to-read-a-book-for-research-ashton/">Ashton Murphy’s entry on reading for research</a> addresses study skills faculty may assume undergraduates possess when they arrive at college; and <a href="http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/chs-library/2013/07/15/latin-dictionaries/">Vanessa Felso’s entry on latin dictionary resources</a> is a model of clarity, useful for any undergraduate. Use them, and share them!</span></blockquote>]]></content>
