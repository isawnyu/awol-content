Greek, Latin, and Egyptian astrological sources for the various systems  of Terms and their origin are reviewed, followed by preliminary editions  and translations of the relevant sections of the tablets. The system of  Terms is shown to be so far the most technically complex component of  Greek astrology to originate in Babylonia. Over the course of the  Hellenistic period an Egyptian origin was ascribed to the systems of  Terms as it was combined with components of Greek horoscopic astrology.  By Ptolemy's day, this spurious history had largely displaced the true.</div><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><br /></div><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Catharine Lorber and Andrew Meadows</strong>.

This paper gathers  additional data and applies further methods of modern economic analysis  to reach a different conclusion. It shows that the overall Roman economy  was not fully integrated, although the Mediterranean Sea did create  some meaningful integration along a few privileged trade routes. Still,  it is not possible to identify pure market forces that existed in  isolation, since the political structures that maintained the Empire  strongly influenced the movement of money and trade goods.</div><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones</strong>.

In 2005, new data were gathered leading to considerably  enhanced knowledge of its functions and the inscriptions on its  exterior. However, much of the front of the instrument has remained  uncertain due to loss of evidence. We report progress in reading a  passage of one inscription that appears to describe the front of the  Mechanism as a representation of a Greek geocentric cosmology,  portraying the stars, Sun, Moon, and all five planets known in  antiquity. Complementing this, we propose a new mechanical  reconstruction of planetary gearwork in the Mechanism, incorporating an  economical design closely analogous to the previously identified lunar  anomaly mechanism, and accounting for much unresolved physical evidence.</span></div><div id="isaw-papers-5" style="padding-left: 30px;"><br /></div><div id="isaw-papers-5" style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Adam C.

The Syriac text in question has been well-known since it was  published in 1889. This particular passage is studied and commented on  here especially as it appears in a recently cataloged manuscript from  Dayr Al-Za‘farān, in which the passage is completely divorced from its  context in the Cause of All Causes.</div><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><br /></div><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mantha Zarmakoupi</strong>.
