   <title type="text">Loeb Classical Library Books Available Online</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: xx-small;">[Posted 19 January 2010, updated&nbsp; 2 August 2011]</span><br /><br />Ed Donnelly maintains a list of Loeb Classical Library Books Available Online.&nbsp; <br /><a href="http://www.edonnelly.com/loebs.html"><br />DownLOEBables -- Loeb Books Available Free Online</a><br /><blockquote><span style="font-size: 85%;">Things just keep growing. This list was initially a subset of my <a href="http://www.edonnelly.com/google.html">G'Oogle</a> list, which itself had grown out of a post I originally made at <a href="http://www.textkit.com/">textkit</a>. Anyway, this is hoped to be a more-convenient way for us to track all of the freely-available LCL books out there. I have sorted these by Loeb catalog number, so that it will be easier for everyone to know what we have found and what is still missing (but hopefully out there for free, at least those that have passed into the public domain). As always, feel free to email errors or additions, or feel free to post about them at <a href="http://www.textkit.com/">textkit</a>.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 85%;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-size: 85%;">Thanks: Many of you have emailed me additional links or posted them to <a href="http://www.textkit.com/">textkit</a>. My goal is to keep this list as up-to-date as possible, at least until the textkit wiki or whatever they decide to make is up and running and this list can be more easily maintained by the textkit community.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 85%;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-size: 85%;">Note: For some reason, Google does not make all of its pdf books available to computers from outside of the US and Canada. If you try one of these links and don't find an option to download the whole pdf, it may be Google is blocking you. I have no idea why they do this for some, but not all, of the public domain pdf files.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 85%;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-size: 85%;">Final Note: These are just links, I don't have any of the actual files here. All of the sites I link to claim that the books are in the public domain (at least for the United States) but you should review each site's usage agreements before downloading any books from them to make sure that you are not violating any copyright laws.</span></blockquote><br /><script src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=xa-4b4cc6be5f7e0135" type="text/javascript"></script>]]></content>
