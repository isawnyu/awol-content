   <title type="text">VMBA: Virtual Magic Bowl Archive</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp;[First posted in AWOL 17 May 2011. Updated 27 June 2012]</span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/vmba/projects/">VMBA: Virtual Magic Bowl Archive</a><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="Virtual Magic Bowl Archive logo" height="182" src="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/vmba/img/vmba.jpg" title="Virtual Magic Bowl Archive logo" width="205" /></span></blockquote></div><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">The aim of VMBA is to provide an environment that will allow  collaborative work on material that is otherwise difficult to access or  unavailable. The material within this archive consists, at this stage,  of parts of three collections: The Moussaieff Collection, The Dehays  Collection and The Barakat Collection. By providing access to this  material to a number of scholars and their students we aim to encourage  the production of critical editions of these texts and their  publication. A single portal providing access to a shared virtual  environment where this can occur provides a convenient forum for  collaboration between a small group of scholars from different  institutions spread in a number of countries.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">Within VMBA scholars can work on material collaboratively. The virtual  archive provides an environment within which scholars and students can  work in view of each other and take full advantage of the expertise of  the whole collective. Additionally, it will foster a mentoring approach  by encouraging the participation of post graduate students who can  benefit from the watchful eye, comments and suggestions of the more  experienced scholars.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">VMBA is the product of a variety of collaborations within The  University of Southampton and without. I would like to thank and  acknowledge the support and very good will of the EdShare and  i-Solutions teams as well as other administrative and academic  colleagues at The University of Southampton. I would also like to thank  my academic collaborators who have been partners in the formation of the  concept and have offered great encouragement throughout. We are all  thankful to Dr Moussieff, Mr Dehays and the Barakat Gallery for  providing access to their collections for the purposes of academic  study.</span><br /><ul><li><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/vmba/index.html" rel="section" target="_self" title="About VMBA">About VMBA<br />&nbsp;</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/vmba/projects/index.shtml" rel="section" target="_self" title="Projects">Collaborators&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/vmba/documents/index.html" rel="section" target="_self" title="What's in a Magic Bowl?">What's in a Magic Bowl?<br />&nbsp;</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/vmba/get_started/index.html" rel="section" target="_self" title="Get started">Get started</a></span></li></ul></blockquote><div id="content"> <blockquote><h1><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Projects</span></h1><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div id="storyone">  <div class="story">   <h2><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/vmba/projects/AMTLA.html" rel="section" target="_self" title="AMTLA">AMTLA</a>: Aramaic Magical Texts from Late Antiquity</span>   </h2></div><div class="story">   <h2><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/vmba/projects/project%20summary%20and%20popular%20introduction.html" rel="section" target="_self" title="Aggressive Bowls">Aggressive Bowls</a>: Funded by the AHRC</span>   </h2></div></div></blockquote></blockquote><div id="storytwo">  <blockquote><blockquote><div class="story">   <h2><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/vmba/projects/Future%20Projects.html" rel="section" target="_self" title="Future Projects">Future</a>: Publication of the Complete Edition of Berlin Bowls.</span>   </h2></div></blockquote></blockquote><div class="story">   <blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/vmba/projects/The%20Berlin%20Bowls.html" rel="section" target="_self" title="Berlin Bowls">The Berlin Bowls</a>: Catalogue</span></blockquote><h2>    </h2></blockquote></div></div></div><blockquote><h1><a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/vmba/projects/Prosopography%20to%20the%20Babylonian%20Incantations%20Bowls%20An%20Introduction.html" style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Prosopography of the Babylonian Magic Bowls</span></a><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> </span></h1><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Click&nbsp;<a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/vmba/projects/Prosopography%20Bibliography%20and%20Abbreviation%20List.html" target="_self" title="Prosopography Bibliographical and Abbreviation List">'here'</a>&nbsp;for access to Bibliographical and Abbreviation list</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Click&nbsp;<a href="https://sharepoint.soton.ac.uk/sites/vmba/lists/prosopography2/vmba.aspx" target="_self" title="Prosopography Database">'here'</a>&nbsp;for access to the Prosopography Database</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Prosopography of the Babylonian Magic Bowls: An Introduction</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ortal-Paz Saar</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The main reason for compiling a database of personal names included  in the Babylonian magic bowls is a desire to find out more about the  individuals behind the magic. Who were the people that made use of  magical texts and magical items? What can we say about their personal  lives, as reflected in the articles of magic they left behind? There are  several ways to approach these questions, and one of them is  prosopography.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">&nbsp;The prosopographic database uploaded on the Southampton University  website currently comprises names from almost all the magic bowls that  have been published so far, be they Jewish Aramaic, Syriac or Mandaic  texts. Since there is no full bibliography of the subject, there are  likely to be some publications still missing from the database, yet  these are probably few. The database covers all the major publications  of magic bowls corpora (e.g. Montgomery 1913, Naveh and Shaked 1985 and  1993, Levene 2003, MÃ¼ller-Kessler 2005), in addition to numerous  articles that present several bowls (e.g. Gordon 1937 and 1941, Geller  1986), or only one or two bowls (e.g. Obermann 1940, Hunter 1994). Each  item is significant, since every bowl that contains personal names may  shed important light on the questions raised by the database. In  addition to personal names originating in magic bowls, the database also  includes a small number of names derived from lead and parchment  amulets that appear to belong to approximately the same chronological  and geographical frame as the incantation bowls. These items are clearly  marked as distinct from the bowls, yet being a similar type of magical  artifact, the personal names they contain were included in the database...</span><br /></blockquote>]]></content>
