Most ruin  foundations were built with massive block masonry (named “oncolithic” in  this study), while long enclosure-walls claimed areas of several  thousand square meters (up to 6 hectares) for each habitation, including  arable and rocky land. The setting and massive construction of these  enclosures, (originally more than a meter high&nbsp; and with a total length  of ca 150 km), show that they belonged to the sites. These features were  mapped with GPS and used for the GIS study of land use and topography.  </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />Archaeologists in the past believed a few of the then known sites  (ca. 5, while enclosures and connecting paths were unknown) situated on  the old roads, to have been defensible forts or watch-towers because of  their so-called “monumental” or “Cyclopean” masonry, but this study  shows that the massive settlement including landscape opening (landnam)  and structuring (covering an area of ca. 30 sqkm min.) must have been  used for mixed agriculture/animal husbandry.  </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />The area has been re-used by mixed agriculture (emphasis on pastoral  economy) from the second half of the 19th century. Data gained from  ethnoarchaeological study are used to corroborate and classify  archaeological findings.
