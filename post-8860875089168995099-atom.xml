   <title type="text">A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian: Addenda, corrigenda, and supporting bibliography</title>
   <content type="html">&lt;a href="http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/cda_archive/"&gt;A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian: Addenda, corrigenda, and supporting bibliography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian&lt;/i&gt;, edited by Jeremy Black, Andrew George, and Nicholas Postgate, with the assistance of Tina Breckwoldt, Graham Cunningham, Marie-Christine Ludwig, Clemens Reichel, Jonathan Blanchard Smith, Junko Taniguchi and Cornelia Wunsch, was published in Wiesbaden in 1999 by Harrassowitz Verlag, and reprinted the following year with minor corrections. This archive is intended to act as a supplement for users of the dictionary, fulfilling several functions as described below. If sufficient use is made of this web-site, our intention is to up-date the list periodically, perhaps once a year. The majority of new entries would then no longer be justificatory, and the editors welcome further proposals for improvements and additional entries (address above). Where these are adopted they are appropriately attributed and dated. In the preparation of the first edition of the dictionary pressure of time did not permit us to take full account of all the material in the reviews of the two dictionaries and in the AfO listings, although a fair amount was incorporated from these sources.&amp;nbsp; For the second edition, we shall attempt to remedy this, and also to revise any letters which have since appeared in CAD (from R onwards). We will also take account of reviews of the CDA. This material will in due course be woven into this web-site, so that it should function as a rolling preview of the second edition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;The above is the site as originally presented by &lt;span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: small;"&gt;Nicholas Postgate at Cambridge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.soas.ac.uk/cda-archive/"&gt;A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian: Justifications, Addenda and Corrigenda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;is the version as currently maintained by Martin Worthington at SOAS.</content>
