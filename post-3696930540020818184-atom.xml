The floor of the plain is covered with mounds, most of  which are now known to have preclassical remains. Early in the fall of  1933 the Expedition staff realized the value of an archeological survey  which would take the form of an inventory of all the mounds in the Plain  of Antioch and its tributary river valleys. The purpose of an  archeological survey of this type is the complete reconnaissance of a  certain area to discover what, if anything, within that area is of  archeological interest.</p>  <p>It was not until the spring of 1936 that such a survey was carried  out. The emphasis of this survey is admittedly preclassical; no attempt  was made to investigate sites which were not in the form of the  characteristic mound. The survey was accomplished in three weeks, but in  the case of several mounds the material collected at that time was  amplified by sherds picked up in previous years by the various members  of the Expedition.</p>  <p>In this volume are presented the names of all the mounds in the Plain  of Antioch, with their positions fixed on maps, as well as indications  of the various cultural periods during which they were occupied and of  the distribution of remains of each period.</p>   <ul><li>Oriental Institute Publications 48</li><li>Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1937</li><li>Pp. xi + 67; 9 figures, 27 maps</li></ul><br /><br /><br />For a complete and up to date list of all of the ca. two hundred and seventy volumes of Oriental Institute publications available online see <a href="http://ancientworldbloggers.blogspot.com/2008/04/awol-ancient-world-online-2.html">AWOL - The Ancient World Online - 2: The Oriental Institute Electronic Publications Initiative</a>.<br /><br /><a title="data:post.title" url="data:post.url" class="addthis_button"><img src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif" alt="Bookmark and Share" style="border: 0pt none;" height="16" width="125" /></a>]]></content>
