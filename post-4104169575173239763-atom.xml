   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.ancient.eu.com/">Ancient History Encyclopedia</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://www.ancient.eu.com/template/images/logo.png" src="http://www.ancient.eu.com/template/images/logo.png" /> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Our Vision</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ancient History Encyclopedia is a source of ancient history  information, provided by a community of historians and history  enthusiasts. The goal is to make quality ancient history information  freely available on the internet, which is something that is clearly  missing: Books are expensive, Wikipedia is comprehensive but unreliable,  and&nbsp; many other sites are either amateurish, with a nationalist agenda,  or their presentation is so bad that it nearly makes them useless. </span><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Peer Review</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">In order to make Ancient History Encyclopedia a free source of  quality information, all content on this website is reviewed for quality  before it is published. We aim to <a href="http://www.ancient.eu.com/news/120/">peer review</a> as much content as possible to ensure quality. Our team consists of  volunteers who are qualified in the field of ancient history, such as  teachers, historians, archaeologists, or writers. If you wish to help,  please contact us. </span><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Non-Profit</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ancient History Encyclopedia is a non-profit website. There is no  company behind the site, and we do not aim to make money. As you have  noticed, we don't have any ads on the site: This is because we believe  that a good presentation is key in conveying information --  advertisements only distract from what's important. <br /><br />Having said that, there are currently two ways in which we make some  money: All the books on this site come from Amazon, and when you buy a  book through our site, we get a small commission. Also, in the Google  search there are some ads, for which we also get money when you click  them. All money that we earn is used to pay for the servers, and for  upgrading to better servers. We want to give you a great user experience  without endless waiting for your information. </span></blockquote><div id="header_menu">                     <blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.ancient.eu.com/index/">Index</a>                    <a href="http://www.ancient.eu.com/timeline/">Timeline</a>                    <a href="http://www.ancient.eu.com/books/">Books</a>                    <a href="http://www.ancient.eu.com/static/about/">About</a>                    <a href="http://www.ancient.eu.com/register/::" title="Registration">Register</a><a href="http://www.ancient.eu.com/login/::" title="Login">Login</a></span></blockquote></div>]]></content>
