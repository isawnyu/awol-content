   <title type="text">Catalogue of Paraliterary Papyri</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://cpp.arts.kuleuven.be/">Catalogue of Paraliterary Papyri</a><br />Professor <a href="https://perswww.kuleuven.be/%7Eu0013314/">Marc Huys</a> and Collaborators<br /><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">The CPP is an electronic catalogue of paraliterary papyri based on a  Filemaker Pro database and implemented for the internet with  php-programming. It contains descriptions of Greek papyri and other  written materials which, because of their paraliterary character, cannot  be found in the standard electronic corpora of literary and documentary  papyri, the <a href="http://www.tlg.uci.edu/" style="text-decoration: none;"><i>Thesaurus Linguae Graecae</i> (TLG)</a> and the <a href="http://odyssey.lib.duke.edu/papyrus/texts/DDBDP.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><i>Duke Data Bank of Documentary Papyri</i>  (DDBDP)</a>, so that they cannot be easily consulted or searched by non  specialists. Generally, these texts have been published in scattered  editions and, because of their diversity, have never been brought  together in one collection. With the CPP project we want to fill this  gap by making all the source materials easily accessible. This includes  also a digital version of full text editions of the paraliterary  fragments, both in plain beta code and in Unicode. The texts in beta  code are simple transcriptions without any accentuation or diacritical  signs, designed only to allow for easy searching. They are inserted into  the CPP database as a separate field. The Unicode versions, on the  contrary, are being presented as documents made accessible out of the  CPP by a link. All Greek texts have been encoded with XML according to  the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/" style="text-decoration: none;">TEI</a>-guidelines  and by an automatic conversion program they are now systematically  being translated in the HTML-files displayed online. Although the CPP  collection does not have the ambition to produce new scholarly editions,  the texts are never simple reproductions of one particular edition but  they are based on our own representation of the most recent edition or  simply of the one we considered the best, and of the comparison with  other editions. For the purposes of specialised research consultation of  the printed editions remains necessary. In addition the CPP contains  some unpublished material, but generally, less detailed information is  available for these items, depending on the policy of the owning  institution. The Search System has been designed so as to make possible  many different types of complex searches, of which the Search Page  presents some predetermined selections.</span></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><a expr:id="data:post.url" expr:name="data:post.title" href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=116259103207720939" onclick="return addthis_sendto()" onmouseout="addthis_close()" onmouseover="return addthis_open(this, &quot;&quot;, this.id, this.name);"><img alt="Bookmark and Share so Your Real Friends Know that You Know" height="16" src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/lg-share-en.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" width="125" /></a> <script src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js?pub=xa-4a3fbb0e7571e986" type="text/javascript"></script></div>]]></content>
