   <title type="text">JSTOR in WorldCat.org</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.oclc.org/">OCLC</a> issued this <a href="http://www.oclc.org/us/en/news/releases/2010/20103.htm">news release</a> last week:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span><p><span style="font-size:85%;"><strong></strong></span></p><blockquote><p><span style="font-size:85%;"><strong>DUBLIN, Ohio, USA, 15 January 2010—</strong>Authenticated scholars and researchers with online access to full-text content in JSTOR can now locate and connect to articles through WorldCat.org.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size:85%;">Over 4.5 million JSTOR article-level records from more than 1,000 journals, selected monographs, and other scholarly content are now indexed in WorldCat.org, the Web destination for discovery of materials in libraries worldwide. JSTOR records are delivered in WorldCat.org search results. Scholars and researchers using WorldCat.org can now identify content in JSTOR and connect to the full-text using the authorization provided by their library.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size:85%;">“JSTOR is invaluable for researchers and scholars around the world,” said Jay Jordan, OCLC President and CEO. “OCLC is honored to partner with JSTOR in this endeavor, which will significantly increase the visibility and availability of these digital resources via the Internet. This is an important advance for the international scholarly community.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-size:85%;">WorldCat.org is a Web destination with search and social networking features that allow information seekers to discover, localize, and personalize content from local collections and those of more than 10,000 WorldCat libraries worldwide. WorldCat.org indexing of JSTOR metadata helps researchers easily identify resources in the collection alongside other materials relevant to their work. An authorization is required for access to full-text materials in JSTOR.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size:85%;">“Users want to access important scholarly content in myriad ways,” said Michael Spinella, JSTOR Managing Director. “Millions of WorldCat.org users around the world will now be able to locate the content in JSTOR licensed by their libraries quickly and easily. This is a fantastic development that we believe will serve OCLC member libraries and their communities well.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-size:85%;">WorldCat is the world’s largest database of bibliographic information built continuously by libraries around the world since 1971. Each record in the WorldCat database contains a bibliographic description of a single item or work and a list of institutions that hold the item. The institutions share these records, using them to create local catalogs, arrange interlibrary loans and conduct reference work.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size:85%;">There are now more than 165 million records in WorldCat spanning five millennia of recorded knowledge. Like the knowledge it describes, WorldCat grows steadily. Every second, OCLC and its member libraries add seven records to WorldCat.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-size:85%;">About JSTOR</span></h3> <p><span style="font-size:85%;"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</a> is a preservation archive and research platform for the academic community. Through JSTOR, faculty, researchers, and students are able to discover, use, and build upon a wide range of content in a trusted digital archive of over 1,000 academic journals, as well as conference proceedings, monographs, and other scholarly content. More than 6,000 libraries and cultural heritage institutions and hundreds of the world’s leading publishers of scholarly literature participate in and support JSTOR. JSTOR is part of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ithaka.org/">ITHAKA</a>, a not-for-profit organization helping the academic community use digital technologies to advance scholarship and teaching in sustainable ways. ITHAKA also includes two additional services—Ithaka S+R and Portico.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-size:85%;">About OCLC</span></h3> <p><span style="font-size:85%;">Founded in 1967, OCLC is a nonprofit, membership, computer library service and research organization dedicated to the public purposes of furthering access to the world’s information and reducing library costs. More than 72,000 libraries in 112 countries have used OCLC services to locate, acquire, catalog, lend, preserve and manage library materials. Researchers, students, faculty, scholars, professional librarians and other information seekers use OCLC services to obtain bibliographic, abstract and full-text information when and where they need it. OCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat, the world’s largest online database for discovery of library resources.
