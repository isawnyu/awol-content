   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collectionsSeals.asp">The Morgan Library &amp; Museum: Ancient Near Eastern Seals &amp; Tablets</a><br /><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Morgan's seals collection is one of the most distinguished in the  United States and among the best known in the world. Generally only an  inch in height, engraved seals are among the smallest objects ever  produced by sculptors. They were carved in great detail with simple  tools on semiprecious stones. These engraved objects provide a  continuous artistic and chronological sequence of more than three  thousand years. The seals collection covers all the significant styles  of Mesopotamian engraving from the end of the fifth millennium <span class="small">B.C.</span> to the fourth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>  as well as most of the styles of other countries of the ancient Near  East. Areas of particular strength include seals of the second  millennium <span class="small">B.C.</span> made outside southern  Mesopotamia (Cappadocia, Syria, and Mitannia) as well as Old Babylonian  and Neo-Assyrian seals. The Middle Assyrian seals are among the finest  in any collection.<br /><br />Pierpont Morgan collected nearly three thousand cuneiform tablets, the  bulk of which are now in the Yale Babylonian Collection, which he  founded. The Morgan's collection also includes cuneiform tablets and a  few outstanding art objects from the ancient Near East.</span> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /><br />Between 1885 and 1908, the American collector William Hayes Ward  assembled, probably on Pierpont Morgan's behalf, a collection of 1,157  seals. This became the core of the Morgan's holdings. Two additional  major gifts—the collection of Robert F. Kelley, given by his sister  Caroline M. Burns in 1977, and that of Jonathan P. Rosen, given in  1986—have enhanced the Morgan's holdings in this area.</span> </blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;Views: <a href="http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collectionsListThumbs.asp?id=Seals">List</a> | <a href="http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collectionsPaging.asp?id=Seals">Single work</a> |</blockquote><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><br /><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=116259103207720939&amp;postID=8246424762897007409" id="data:post.url" name="data:post.title" onclick="return addthis_sendto()" onmouseout="addthis_close()" onmouseover="'return"><img alt="Bookmark and Share so Your Real Friends Know that You Know" height="16" src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/lg-share-en.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" width="125" /></a><script src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js?pub=xa-4a3fbb0e7571e986" type="text/javascript"></script></div>]]></content>
