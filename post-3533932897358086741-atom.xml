   <title type="text">Durham University Library Special Collections Catalogue: The Sudan Archive</title>
   <content type="html">&lt;a href="http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=ead/sad/sudan.xml"&gt;Durham University Library Special Collections Catalogue: The Sudan Archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;div id="didtop"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;span class="topdid"&gt;Reference code:  &lt;/span&gt;GB-0033-SAD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="topdid"&gt;Title:  &lt;/span&gt;The Sudan Archive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="topdid"&gt;Dates of creation:  &lt;/span&gt;ca.1880 onwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="topdid"&gt;Extent:  &lt;/span&gt;800  boxes of papers, 50,000 photographs, 136 cinefilms, 1,000 maps, museum  objects and a large amount of related printed material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="topdid"&gt;Held by:  &lt;/span&gt;Durham University Library, Archives and Special Collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;The Sudan Archive was founded in 1957, the year after Sudanese  independence, to collect and preserve the papers of administrators from  the Sudan Political Service, missionaries, soldiers, business men,  doctors, agriculturalists, teachers and others who had served or lived in the Sudan during the Anglo-Egyptian  Condominium. It comprises over 330 individual collections of official,  semi-official and private papers of British men and women. Each  collection is named after the donor who is usually the creator of the records. The collections vary in size from  one file to 180 boxes. All levels of colonial society are represented,  from Assistant District Commissioner to Governor-General and senior  officers of government, as well as from the technical and medical services, the army and the church. The core  period covered is 1898-1955, but there is a significant amount of  Mahdist material as well as papers relating to the military campaigns of  the 1880s and 1890s, while in recent years the scope of the Archive has extended to the period after  independence and now contains material up to the present day. Moreover,  as officials were frequently seconded or posted to neighbouring  countries, or simply passed through them on leave, the Archive also holds substantial numbers of papers relating to  Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, Palestine, Transjordan, Syria and African  states bordering on the Sudan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to official and personal papers (correspondence, reports and  memoranda, trek notes and diaries, letters home and so on), collections  may include a variety of records in other formats such as photographic  images (prints, lantern slides and 35mm slides), cinefilms from the 1920s to the 1960s, sound  recordings, maps, museum objects and a large amount of related printed  material. Most of the material is in English, with a small amount in  Arabic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>
