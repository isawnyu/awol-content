   <title type="text">L'ANNÉE PHILOLOGIQUE update</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[The following message was distributed by email this morning to members of the<a href="http://www.apaclassics.org/"> APA</a> and is reproduced here with permission (hyperlinks added).<br /><pre><blockquote><span style="font-size:85%;">Dear APA Member:<br /><br />We are very pleased to announce that <a href="http://www.annee-philologique.com/aph/">L'ANNÉE PHILOLOGIQUE on the<br />Internet (APh Online)</a> now has a new and more powerful user interface.<br />Here are some of its most important new features:<br /><br />• A Quick Search screen now appears on the initial page and is available<br />on all subsequent screens.<br /><br />• A single screen presents all available indices and filters for<br />advanced searches.<br /><br />• Each page of search results can be sorted by Author, Title, or<br />Publication Date.<br /><br />• An AJAX script makes indices for modern and ancient authors more<br />powerful.  As the user starts typing in the text box, a list of possible<br />selections begins to appear, and the list is refined as each letter is<br />added or removed.<br /><br />• More options are available for exporting records including: text file,<br />PDF File, RIS Format, and RefWorks.<br /><br />• Users can save searches, records, and personal parameters such as<br />sorting options, number of results per page, and e-mail address.<br /><br />• APh Online has migrated to OpenURL 1.0 which facilitates rapid<br />"clicking through" to an electronic version of modern scholarship cited<br />in an APh record such as a full-text article in JStor.<br /><br />We are very grateful to the <a href="http://www.mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a> for its generous<br />grant of $48,000 to support the planning of these upgrades, which were<br />designed by Prof. Eric Rebillard, Director and Editor of APh Online,<br />with input from Classics librarians and colleagues from the Cornell<br />University Library.<br /><br />I am also pleased to report that APA members can look forward to another<br />major improvement in the near future.  The Mellon Foundation has just<br />awarded the APA a major grant ($215,000) to create the Classical Works<br />Knowledge Base (CWKB), a relational database and link resolver that will<br />allow users of APh Online to "click through" from citations of ancient<br />texts in an APh record to online versions of those texts, i.e., to do<br />for ancient texts what is already possible for modern ones.  Prof.<br />Rebillard will also direct this project in collaboration with Cornell<br />librarians David Ruddy and Adam Chandler.  A fuller description of the<br />project and a prototype can be found at <a href="http://cwkb.org/">cwkb.org</a>.<br /><br />And in the latest development, a planning grant from the <a href="http://www.kressfoundation.org/">Samuel H. Kress<br />Foundation</a> has made it possible for Prof. Rebillard to begin exploring<br />the possibility of linking from images cited in L'ANNÉE records to<br />online versions of the images themselves.  I hope to have good news<br />about this initiative by the end of my Presidency this Winter.<br /><br />As the Director of the Database of Classical Bibliography project, which<br />was completed last year, I am particularly pleased to see how the<br />earliest CDROMs, published by the APA in the 1980's, have been<br />transformed into an up-to-date, web-based resource for the 21st century.<br />Members must understand that our ability to continue to bring this kind<br />of major improvement to the field of Classics depends on the success of<br />the current Gateway campaign.  If we cannot continue to operate the<br />American Office of L'ANNÉE after the current NEH funding ends, we will<br />be unable to influence the further development of this vital scholarly<br />resource.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.apaclassics.org/campaign/campaign.html">Gateway campaign's Endowment for Classics Research and Teaching</a> will<br />be able to serve both immediate needs like those of the American Office<br />and future needs that we cannot yet envision.  If you have not yet made<br />a pledge to the Gateway campaign, it is very important that you do so<br />now.  If you have already made a contribution, won’t you consider<br />increasing it?
