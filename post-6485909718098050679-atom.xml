   <title type="text">Engendering Roman Military Spaces</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/milspace_leic_2008/">Engendering Roman Military Spaces</a><br />Penelope M. Allison, 2008 (updated 2012)<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The research project 'Engendering Roman Military Spaces',  investigates socio-spatial behaviour inside Roman military forts during  the early Empire. It uses the distribution of artefacts found in forts  in the German provinces to analyse the activities carried out within the  various components of these forts. It then investigates the  relationships between these spaces and the members of these communities -  both soldier and non-soldier - who were likely to have been engaged in  these activities. In so doing it develops better understandings of the  complexity of the daily life within such military establishments. It  focuses particularly on evidence for women and children and on their  roles within these military domains.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">  </span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The project challenges widely-held assumptions: that military  communities in the early empire were essentially segregated soldier  communities; that only senior officers' families and household were  accommodated inside and any other camp-followers lived in the civilian  settlements outside the fort walls; and that a ban on legal marriage for  ordinary soldiers meant that they could not have had families with whom  they could have co-habited before the end of the 2nd century AD.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">  </span><div style="float: right; position: relative;">  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><img src="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/milspace_leic_2008/images/Saalburgmuseumspindles.jpg" /></span>  <div style="font-style: italic; position: relative; top: -10px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Spindle whorls and loom weights in the museum of the Roman fort at Saalburg</span></div></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">  </span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">This study demonstrates that analyses of artefact distribution  patterns, along with those of the structural remains, provide more  nuanced understandings of the functioning of Roman military bases and of  Roman military life. It also demonstrates that women and children were  members of these communities, and that, rather than being the hindrance  that some ancient authors considered them (e.g. Juvenal, <em>Satires</em> VI.398-405; Herodian, <em>Histories</em> 3.8.4), they may have taken useful and productive roles in the functioning of these military establishments.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">  </span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The archive holds the datasets and interactive maps produced by this  project, and is a companion to the forthcoming publication, <em>Frontier Communities in the Early Roman Empire: artefactual evidence for women and children inside German military bases</em> [working title]. The project, Engendering Roman Spaces, was funded by  an Australian Research Council QEII Fellowship held at the Australian  National University. </span><br /><ul class="dlMenu"><li>  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/milspace_leic_2008/index.cfm">Introduction</a></span> </li><li>  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/milspace_leic_2008/overview.cfm">Overview</a></span> </li><li>    <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/milspace_leic_2008/map.cfm">Interactive Map</a></span>   </li><li>     <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/milspace_leic_2008/downloads.cfm">Downloads</a></span>  </li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">   <a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/milspace_leic_2008/stats.cfm">Usage Statistics</a></span>  </li></ul></blockquote><div id="archiveheader">      </div>]]></content>
