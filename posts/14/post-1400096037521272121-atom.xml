   <title type="text">British Library Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts: Glossaries</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossA.asp">British Library Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts: </a><a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossA.asp">Glossaries</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="text"><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/null"><img alt="Harley MS 2904, f. 144" border="0" src="http://www.bl.uk/IllImages/Glossary/thm/abbreviation/K037698.jpg" /></a><img src="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/images/spacer.gif" width="10" /> </span><br /><span class="text"></span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="text"> <span style="font-size: x-small;">Abbreviations were often used to save space and effort when writing. They generally fall into three categories: <em>suspensions,</em> in which the end of a word is abbreviated, signalled by the use of a horizontal bar or another graphic symbol; <em>contractions,</em> in which another part of a word is abbreviated with the use of a graphic symbol; <em>abbreviation</em> <em>symbols,</em> used for whole words and often derived from the tachygraphic (shorthand) systems of <a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossA.asp#ANTIQUITY">ANTIQUITY</a> (that of Tiro, Cicero's secretary, being most influential). All three  types of abbreviation could be used in the same manuscript, as variable  and invariable forms and as phonetic equivalents.</span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="text"> </span></span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="text"></span></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">During Antiquity a few common elements were often abbreviated (notably the Latin word endings <em>-bus</em> and <em>-que</em> and the final <em>m </em>and <em>n).</em> These short forms are known as <em>notae</em> <em>communes,</em> while abbreviations for specialized jargon in legal texts are known as <em>notae</em> <em>iuris.</em> Abbreviations for <em>nomina</em> <em>sacra</em> ('sacred names'), such as the Greek <em>xps</em> form of <em>Christus</em> (see <a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossC.asp#CHI-RHO">CHI-RHO</a>), occur in <a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossE.asp#EARLYCHRISTIAN">EARLY CHRISTIAN </a>works. <a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossI.asp#INSULAR">INSULAR</a> scribes were especially fond of abbreviations, including tironian <em>notae,</em> and Irish scribes used them extensively in order to produce pocket-size <a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossG.asp#GOSPELBOOK">GOSPEL BOOKS</a> for study purposes (pocket Gospels). With the growth of universities,  from around 1200, the use of abbreviations proliferated. Medieval  readers would have been familiar with such devices, although there were  probably always some that were particularly obscure, and there is  evidence that <a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossS.asp#SCRIBE">SCRIBES</a> themselves sometimes puzzled over certain abbreviations.&nbsp;</span><br /></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="text"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossA.asp">A</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossB.asp">B</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossC.asp">C</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossD.asp">D</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossE.asp">E</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossF.asp">F</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossG.asp">G</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossH.asp">H</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossI.asp">I</a>&nbsp; 	J&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossK.asp">K</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossL.asp">L</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossM.asp">M</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossN.asp">N</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossO.asp">O</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossP.asp">P</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossQ.asp">Q</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossR.asp">R</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossS.asp">S</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossT.asp">T</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossU.asp">U</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossV.asp">V</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossW.asp">W</a>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossX.asp">X</a>&nbsp; 	Y&nbsp; 	<a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossZ.asp">Z</a>&nbsp;   <a href="https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossHeb.asp">Hebrew</a>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; 			  </span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="text"></span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">&nbsp;</span></blockquote>]]></content>
