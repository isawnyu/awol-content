      style="font-size: x-small;">Modern technology in general, digital in particular, have added
      new dimensions as well as more sophisticated vocational requirements to the field of Library
      and Information Science, from which researches and knowledge lovers benefit. Amidst this
      tremendous quantity of forms of the technological revolution, it was natural for the
      Bibliotheca Alexandrina to adopt the concept of digital publication in order to make it
      available to researchers interested in science and knowledge. This, in turn, is what propels
      the Calligraphy Center to provide the study of inscriptions, calligraphy, and writings of the
      world across the ages from the prehistoric age until now with a new approach and vision. From
      this premise, the idea of the Digital Library of Inscriptions and Calligraphies was
      generated.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br
      /></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">This project comes at the head of the
      Center of the Studies of Writings and Calligraphy’s objectives, which has taken upon itself the
      publication of different inscriptions and writings; in particular, inscriptions in different
      languages and writings from Egypt and abroad, which the center has made available to
      scientists, researchers, and amateurs in a simplified digital content through the website.
      </span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br
      /></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The project of the Digital Library of
      Inscriptions and Calligraphies is considered a digital record for writings carved on buildings
      and archaeological remains across the ages. These inscriptions are presented to the user in a
      digital form, including a synopsis of the inscription’s data, photos, and a record of the
      writing’s it bears .</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br
      /></span><br /><div style="width: 850px;"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">The project has been adopted in the present time to record a group of languages in
      numerous scripts, including Ancient Egyptian, Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Greek; developing
      the inscriptions of each script separately, and recording a new group of other languages’
      scripts. The basic data and detailed descriptions of these inscriptions are displayed in two
      languages: Arabic and English.
      </span></div></blockquote><blockquote><div style="width:
      850px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Project organizers were keen to build a
      flexible, user-friendly website for the Digital Library of Inscriptions and Calligraphies in
      order to enable a large number of researchers to benefit from the gems of archaeological
      written inscriptions and further browse the images and references of each inscription
      separately. The inscriptions can be easily browsed by language, or the classification of the
      inscription; architecture, arts, or sculpture as well as the type of the archaeological remain.
      It is possible to find a specific inscription using the advanced search feature which allows
      the user to search by the artifact’s number, place of preservation, or place of discovery, and
      also by the period of time to which the written inscription belongs. At this moment, the
      researcher will find all the information related to the archaeological remain accompanied with
      high-quality images, analysis of the written inscription, information and a descriptive
      synopsis of the remain as well as a translation of the inscription.
      </span></div></blockquote><blockquote><div style="width:
      850px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Calligraphy Center aspires to make the
      Digital Library of Inscriptions one of the most important digital libraries specializing in the
      field of inscriptions and writings on the
      internet</span>.</div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><ul
