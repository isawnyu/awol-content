      Derveni Papyrus: An Interdisciplinary Research Project</a><br /><blockquote
      class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Editors : Leonard Muellner, G. Nagy,
      Ioanna Papadopoulou</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Information
      Architects: Saïd Esteban Belmehdi, Julien Razanajao, François Recher.</span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Over the last 45 years the text of the Derveni
      Papyrus has undergone extensive reconstruction and study. Theokritos Kouremenos, George M.
      Parássoglou, and Kyriakos Tsantsanoglou have been among the leaders of this effort, publishing
      an authoritative text of the papyrus along with extensive commentary in 2006 (Casa Leo S.
      Olschki, Firenze).</span><br /><h2><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Introduction to the Text by K. Tsantsanoglou</span></h2><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">The Derveni papyrus is a most interesting new document
      of&nbsp; Greek literature. It is perhaps the only papyrus to have been found on Greek soil,
      and is, if not the oldest Greek papyrus ever found, no doubt the oldest literary papyrus, dated
      roughly between 340 and 320 B.C. Its name derives from the site where it was discovered, some
      six miles north of Thessaloniki, in whose Archaeological Museum it is now preserved. It was
      found among the remnants of a funeral pyre in one of the tombs in the area, which has also
      yielded extremely rich artifacts, primarily items of metalware. After the exacting job of
      unrolling and separating the layers of the charred papyrus roll, and then of joining the
      numerous fragments&nbsp; together again, 26 columns of text were recovered, all with their
      bottom parts missing, as they had perished on the pyre.</span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">The book, composed near the end of the 5th century B.C.,
      contains the eschatological teaching of a mantis; the content is divided between religious
      instructions on sacrifices to gods and souls, and allegorical commentary on a
      theogonical&nbsp; poem ascribed to Orpheus. The author’s outlook is philosophical,
      displaying, in particular, a physical system close to those of Anaxagoras, the Atomists, and
      Diogenes of Apollonia. His allegorical method of interpretation is especially interesting,
      frequently reminiscent of Socrates’ playful mental and etymological&nbsp; acrobatics as
      seen in Plato’s Cratylus. The identification of the author is a matter of&nbsp; dispute
      among scholars. Names like Euthyphron of Prospalta, Diagoras&nbsp; of Melos, and
      Stesimbrotus of Thasos have been proposed with varying degrees of
      likelihood.</span><br /><h2><span style="font-size: x-small;">The
      Digital edition of the Derveni Papyrus</span></h2><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">A few years ago The Center for Hellenic Studies made the Greek text of the papyrus
      available online, as it was published in 2006, © Olschki, Firenze.</span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The following key institutions worked in
      conjunction for this online project:</span><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><a href="http://www.olschki.it/">Casa Leo S. Olschki</a>, Firenze,
      Italy</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a
      href="http://www.unige.it/">Universita degli Studi di Genova</a>,
      Italy</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a
      href="http://www.auth.gr/home/index_en.html">Aristotle University of Thessaloniki</a>,
      Greece</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a
      href="http://www.amth.gr/en/info.html">Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki</a>,
      Greece</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a
      href="http://chs.harvard.edu/">Center for Hellenic Studies</a>, Harvard University,
      USA</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Continuing our effort to
      improve the digital edition of the Derveni Papyrus, we developed a new form for the text under
      the framework of the CHS-iMouseion Project. This user-friendly teaching and research tool
      offers the option of masking or revealing the readings of the editors by simply clicking on the
      text (wherever the arrow appears). Furthermore, one can easily navigate from one column to
      another, either successively via the arrows or randomly via the sidebar menu. The iMouseion
      architecture provides as well the possibility of a multiversion Derveni Papyrus. Due to the
      existence of unplaced fragments, this exceptionally challenging document is still being
      reconstructed. New reconstructions can be displayed side by side, offering a simultaneous view
      of the different versions of each column.</span><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">As the study of the papyrus continues, the CHS Derveni Papyrus Project team
      updates the content of this site. The CHS held a Conference in July 2008. The Proceedings are
      now available here. Furthermore, we are happy to announce the new edition of the first six
      columns by Franco Ferrari, under the multiversion iMouseion environment, as well as the
      articles and images which complete this new edition.</span><br /><h2><span
