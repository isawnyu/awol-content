   <title type="text">The Library of Antiquity Teaches the TLG</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://libraryofantiquity.wordpress.com/" rel="home" title="The Library of Antiquity">The Library of Antiquity: Tips and Tricks for the Study of the Ancient Mediterranean</a><br />Jaclyn Neel's and Mary Franks's excellent <a href="https://libraryofantiquity.wordpress.com/about/"><i>Library of Antiquity</i></a> is producing a series of extremely useful guides to the use of the new TLG:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The&nbsp;<i>TLG</i> remains one of the most useful Classics tools. Last year, we laid out how to use the ‘classic’ interface in a <a href="https://libraryofantiquity.wordpress.com/2015/02/28/help-with-greek-texts-tlg-part-1-browsing/">series</a> of <a href="https://libraryofantiquity.wordpress.com/2015/03/29/help-with-greek-texts-tlg-part-3-advanced-search/">posts</a>. And then (of course!) the site <a href="https://libraryofantiquity.wordpress.com/2015/05/07/quick-takes-tlg-is-updated/">updated</a>, with a completely new look and some new features. In this post, I (re)introduce the features that you’re most likely to use. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Please note: for <i>TLG</i> die-hards, the old <i>TLG</i> is  still available! If you are a master at the old site, there’s no need to  learn the new one — yet. But most of the features are similar enough  that the move won’t hurt. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Unlike the <a href="https://libraryofantiquity.wordpress.com/2015/03/18/help-with-greek-texts-tlg-part-2-searching/">old <i>TLG</i></a>, the new <i>TLG</i> lays out its main features in a horizontal bar at the top of the page. Although this post focuses on the&nbsp;<i>search</i> and&nbsp;<i>browse</i> features, the&nbsp;<i>lexica</i> (and some others that are not in the screenshot, like <i>N-grams</i>)  are new features. The dictionaries are usable on all texts; the  statistical features are not, and were not activated in any of the texts  I used on my last&nbsp;<i>TLG</i> visit (all Roman-era historiographers). Stay tuned for an update.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="https://libraryofantiquity.wordpress.com/2016/06/03/help-with-greek-texts-the-new-tlg-introduction/">Help with Greek Texts: The New TLG&nbsp;(introduction)</a></span><br /><span class="jp-relatedposts-post-title" style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="jp-relatedposts-post-a" data-origin="342" data-position="0" href="https://libraryofantiquity.wordpress.com/2015/02/28/help-with-greek-texts-tlg-part-1-browsing/" rel="nofollow" title="Help with Greek texts: TLG part 1 (Browsing)  As February winds to a close, it seemed like a good time to get started on the TLG guide we promised you.
