      2009]</span><br /><br />Through its <a
      href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/">Open Collections Program</a>, the Harvard
      University Library is presenting new, virtual collections of thematically linked material
      selected from numerous Harvard repositories. For the study of the ancient world, the <a

      a range of worldwide expeditions from 1626 to 1953.<br /><br />Archaeological

      Museum Expeditions to Kaminaljuyú, Guatemala, 1935–1953</a><blockquote><span
      style="font-size:85%;">Between 1935 and 1953, the Carnegie Institution of Washington
      excavated Kaminaljuyú and established it as one the most significant archaeological
      Pre-Columbian sites in Mesoamerica. Kaminaljuyú (meaning, in the Quiché language, "Hills of the
      Dead") grew from an agricultural community (ca. 2500 BCE) in the central highlands of Guatemala
      to become a large ceremonial site and political Maya capital that flourished until about 800
      CE.</span></blockquote></li><br /><li><a
      href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/expeditions/reisner.html">Harvard Expedition to Samaria,
      1908–1910</a><blockquote><span style="font-size:85%;">Harvard’s Committee on
      Exploration in the Orient designated the American archaeologist George A. Reisner to direct the
      University’s expedition to Samaria. With sponsorship from Jacob H. Schiff, the expedition was
      intended to excavate the site of Samaria (Sebaste), which was the capital of the ancient
      Kingdom of Israel.<br /><br />Reisner located remains of the royal palace built by
      Omri and Ahab during the Israelite period, as well as remnants of buildings constructed during
      later periods of occupation by Babylonians, Greeks, and Romans. Noteworthy among the artifacts
      found were ostraca, or pottery fragments, depicting Hebrew-character inscriptions in carbon ink
      of Biblical names and memoranda of commercial
      shipments.</span></blockquote></li></ul><a
