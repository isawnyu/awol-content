   <title type="text">Announcing the NEH-Mellon Fellowships for Digital Publication </title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/grant-news/announcing-the-neh-mellon-fellowships-digital-publication">Announcing the NEH-Mellon Fellowships for Digital Publication&nbsp;</a><br /><div class="title-section">  		<div id="top-byline">  			February 25, 2016 								 | By Brett Bobley</div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div id="top-byline">	<span style="font-size: x-small;">I'm very pleased that the Office of Digital Humanities has teamed up  with our colleagues in the NEH's Division of Research as well as our  friends at the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to offer this new fellowship  program. If you are a scholar doing research which will result in a  digital publication, I urge you to consider applying to this program!&nbsp; </span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div id="top-byline">  	<span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Announcing the NEH-Mellon Fellowships for Digital Publication</strong></span><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">	Great scholarship can be communicated in many forms â€“ books and  articles, of course, but also through multimedia, including interactive  or enhanced ebooks, websites, audio clips, videos, and other formats.  Today, we are also seeing scholarly presses begin to peer review and  publish digital publications of various kinds. To help accelerate the  creation of these new forms of scholarly communication, the National  Endowment for the Humanities and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation are  pleased to announce the <strong>NEH-Mellon Fellowships for Digital Publication. </strong>This  special opportunity with the NEH Fellowships program seeks to encourage  scholars who are engaged in research leading to digital publications.&nbsp;  For example, for scholarship in fields like art history, musicology, or  media studies, an interactive digital publication may allow the author  to use multimedia to make arguments or illustrate critical points that  would be otherwise difficult or impossible in traditional print  formats.&nbsp; </span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div id="top-byline">  	<span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>NEH-Mellon Fellowships for Digital Publication</strong> support  individual scholars pursuing research projects that require digital  expression and digital publication.&nbsp; To be eligible, the project must be  conceived as digital because the nature of the research and the topics  being addressed demand presentation beyond traditional print  publication.&nbsp; Successful projects will likely incorporate visual, audio,  and/or other multimedia materials or flexible reading pathways that  could not be included in traditionally published books.</span><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">	Because <strong>NEH-Mellon Fellowships for Digital Publication</strong> is a special opportunity within the larger NEH Fellowships competition,  applications with be judged by the same criteria and held to the same  standards of scholarly excellence.&nbsp; Applications received for the  special opportunity will be evaluated by a separate peer review panel of  scholars engaged with humanities research and knowledgeable about  digital humanities/digital publications. </span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div id="top-byline"> <span style="font-size: x-small;">	Like the NEH Fellowships programs, <strong>NEH-Mellon Fellowships for Digital Publication</strong> support continuous full-time work for a period of six to twelve months.  Successful applicants receive a stipend of $4,200 per month. The  maximum stipend is $50,400 for a twelve-month period. </span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div id="top-byline"> <span style="font-size: x-small;">	Applications are due by April 28, 2016. For more information, please consult the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/grants/research/neh-mellon-fellowships-digital-publication">special opportunity guidelines</a> on the NEH website.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">&nbsp;</span></div></blockquote></div><div class="title-section"><span style="font-size: x-small;">&nbsp;</span></div>]]></content>
