    <content type="html"><![CDATA[In the past year <a href="http://www.asor.org/">The American Schools
      of Oriental Research</a> has initiated a variety of way to communicate to and interact
      with the a broad range of constituencies. The venerable <a
      href="http://www.asor.org/pubs/news/index.html"><i>ASOR Newsletter</i></a>
      presents brief summaries of research work done under the auspices of ASOR, and reports on the
      various activities of ASOR's overseas centers in Amman, Jerusalem, and Nicosia as well as
      announcements of various scholarly seminars, the ASOR Annual Meeting, and fellowship
      opportunities. The <a href="http://www.asor.org/pubs/news/back-issues.html">most recent
      seventeen</a> of its sixty-two volumes are freely available online.<br /><br
      />[<a
      href="http://asor.informz.net/InformzDataService/OnlineVersion/Public?mailingInstanceId=3372421">n.b.</a>:
      "Print Newsletter Publication will Continue as <a
      href="http://www.asor.org/news/news-at-asor.html">News@ASOR</a>. As some of you may
      have heard via mail, email, or word-of-mouth, the <a
      href="http://www.asor.org/pubs/news/index.html"><i>ASOR Newsletter</i></a>
      will be discontinued in its print form, and will continue as a free, open resource to all our
      members as the e-newsletter <i>News@ASOR</i> (what you're currently reading). We
      hope to continue providing the information you previously enjoyed from the
      <i>Newsletter</i>, as well as provide a greater insight on the workings and
      happenings of ASOR on a monthly basis".] <br /><br />In January 2013, with the
      support of the Kershaw Family Trust, ASOR began distributing <a
      href="http://www.asor.org/news/news-at-asor.html"><i>News@ASOR</i></a> as
      a bimonthly e-newsletter. The e-newsletter delivers updates on events in the field,
      organizational news, and highlights from the ASOR Blog. All issues are free of charge and <a
      href="http://www.asor.org/news/news-at-asor.html">archived online</a>. <a
      href="http://www.asor.org/news/news-at-asor.html"><i>News@ASOR</i></a>
      includes highlights from the <a href="http://asorblog.org/">ASOR Blog</a>:<br
      /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Welcome to the

      2013 following closely on the heels of <a
      href="http://www.asor.org/news/news-at-asor.html"><i>News@ASOR</i></a> a
      monthly e-newsletter disseminating ideas, insights and discoveries to <a
