      class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Friedberg Genizah Project<br
      />November 12, 2012<br />Announcement No. 12</span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><br />Dear User,</span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><br />"Genazim" is pleased to announce the launching of
      Version 10 of the<br />Genizah website.</span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><br />Following is an overview of the improvements in this
      version.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />A.
      Images<br />1. Cambridge<br />With great satisfaction we announce the recent
      successful completion (on<br />time!) of the complex project of digitizing the entire
      Genizah collection<br />of the Cambridge University Library, a project designed and
      planned in<br />cooperation with the Genizah Research Unit of CUL, and implemented<br
      />by CUL Each fragment of the CUL Genizah was digitized and is<br />currently
      displayed on the website. We are now in the process of applying<br />a final
      comprehensive check to verify that indeed all of the Genizah<br />fragments have been
      digitized, and that no image is missing from our<br />website.</span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />2. Birmingham<br />The Genizah
      collection in the Birmingham Library – including its two<br />sub-collections Mingana and
      Mittwoch – has been digitized in its entirety<br />and is now displayed on the website.
      Our sincere thanks to the Library<br />staff for their generous cooperation in this
      task.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />3.
      Manchester<br />Genazim is glad to report that an agreement has been reached with
      the<br />Manchester University Library, according to which FGP will receive a<br
      />copy of the high-quality images of its entire Genizah collection, together<br />with
      a copy of all the appropriate metadata and cataloging details<br />available there. The
      metadata were already received and are now being<br />processed for integration in the
      website; the images are expected to be<br />received here very soon.</span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />We wish to thank the Library and all
      the Officers and the technical<br />support persons in charge for their cooperation
      spirit, their support and<br />their good will in bringing this important initiative to
      its happy end.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />B.
      "Ginzei Kedem"<br />All the 8 volumes of "Ginzei Kedem" – a Journal devoted to
      Genizah<br />research and published by the Ben-Zvi Institute - can now be viewed as<br
      />PDF files in the website, and can be searched (in a specific volume or in<br />all
      volumes together) for a word, and the appropriate results will be<br />displayed. These
      functions may be operated by clicking on "Ginzei<br />Kedem" on the bottom part of the
      website Homepage.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br
      />C. Software</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />1.
      Physical attributes of a Fragment<br />With the display of an image, it is possible now
      to see important data on<br />the physical attributes of that fragment, such as external
      and internal<br />dimensions, number of lines, margin width, average height of a
      line,<br />density of the text and more, as recently computed automatically by<br
      />Genazim software for almost all Genizah images , by clicking on the icon<br />that
      is found in the list of icons above the image.</span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><br />This function is presently operational for
      shelfmarks that contain only a<br />single folio fragment, and it will be extended to all
      images in the near<br />future.</span><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><br />2. Search on Computerized Data of a fragment's physical
      attributes<br />Until now it was possible to combine in the advanced search the
      physical<br />attributes of a fragment, such as dimensions, number of lines, and
      more,<br />as long as they existed in the catalog record of the corresponding<br
      />shelfmark. With the new version, the user can extend the search to take<br />into
      account also these attributes when they were automatically computed<br />by the
      system.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />3. Filter
      Mechanism<br />For efficiency and simplicity reasons, the default in the filter
      mechanism<br />is now "No Filter", as opposed to the status that existed till
      now.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />4. Various
      Fixes and Enhancements<br />A number of software bugs that appeared very rarely were
      fixed, and a<br />number of small enhancements were introduced that will not be
      detailed<br />here but which the user will notice during his work.</span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />As usual, remarks and suggestions
      would be most welcome.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br
      />Genazim</span></blockquote>]]></content>
