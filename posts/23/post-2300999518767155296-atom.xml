      x-small;">Abstract</span></h4><span style="font-size: x-small;">Michael
      Astour's scholarly productivity was prodigious and was recognized and respected by the
      international community of historians of the ancient Near East. His accomplishments would have
      been impressive in anyone, but were especially so given the tumultuous and tragic events of his
      personal life, which were part and parcel of the tragic and tumultuous century in which he
      lived. The Festschrift that grew out of a celebratory conference in his honor begins with a
      paraphrase of an ancient Sumerian proverb: “A scribe who does not know Sumerian, what kind of a
      scribe is he?” It reads, “Scholars of Mediterranean, Biblical and Near Eastern Studies who do
      not know the work of Michael Astour, what kind of scholars are they?”<a
      href="https://www.blogger.com/null" title="">[1]</a> Obviously, that’s a rhetorical
      and somewhat hyperbolic question, and I lack the knowledge to pass judgment with any confidence
      on his work. Ignorance is easily impressed. Nevertheless, the story of Michael Astour’s life
      deserves to be told, if only by someone who is definitely not a scholar of the ancient Near
      East, but who knew him as a colleague. Many of his friends and colleagues urged him over the
      years to write a memoir, something he adamantly refused to do. This may have been due in part
      to the pain that such an effort would have caused him, although he argued that others had told
      similar stories better than he could. But, finally, he may have regarded such an undertaking
      simply as an unwelcome distraction from the scholarship that he loved and that he pursued
      almost to his dying day.<a href="https://www.blogger.com/null"
      title="">[2]</a></span> </blockquote><blockquote
      class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">This essay is based largely on
      Astour’s voluminous correspondence spanning a half- century. He meticulously saved letters he
      received, as well as copies of those he sent. His papers fill dozens of boxes in SIUE’s
      archives. Many of his letters are multi-paged and are uniformly thoughtful and frequently
      witty. They stand in stark contrast to the brief and often superficial electronic
      communications that pass for inter-personal correspondence today which is, in most cases and,
      perhaps appropriately, transitory. They exemplify a category of historical source material
      that, sadly, is no longer being generated.</span> </blockquote><blockquote
