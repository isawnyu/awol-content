      Langdale: Cyprus Archive</a><br />[December 22, 2010]<br
      /><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">ARTstor is collaborating with
      Allan Langdale to share more than 3,300 images of the historical architecture of Cyprus. This
      collection was compiled between 2006 and 2008 and focuses on the lesser known and, in some
      cases, endangered architecture and archaeological sites of northern Cyprus. The archive
      includes Bronze Age sites such as Enkomi and the Tombs of the Kings, and the early Christian
      basilicas of Salamis. The bulk of the collection consists of dozens of examples of the
      Byzantine architecture of the region, including examples largely unavailable to researchers
      since the embargoes imposed on North Cyprus in 1974. There are detailed sets of images of the
      better-known buildings, such as the Panagia Kanakaria, and a number of medieval churches of
      Nicosia (Lefkosa), such as the St. Sophia Cathedral and the St. Nicholas Cathedral (the
      Bedestan). The most comprehensive portion of the collection focuses on the Lusignan Gothic
      churches of Famagusta, including the cathedrals of St. Nicholas, St. George of the Greeks, St.
      George of the Latins, and Saints Peter and Paul. </span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Allan Langdale is an art historian, photographer, and filmmaker
      whose current research interests are in Cyprus, where he has done work on the medieval and
      Venetian monuments of Famagusta. </span></blockquote><a

      Foundation (Stiftung Preussischer Kulturbesitz) and ARTstor have collaborated to digitize key
      works of Classical sculpture from the Berlin State Museums (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin). Now
      held in the Pergamon Museum and Altes Museum in Berlin, the collection of Classical Antiquities
      (Antikensammlung) is one of the most important collections of Classical art in the world. This
      final release includes approximately 170 images of Greek, Hellenistic, and Roman sculptures,
      bringing the collection total in ARTstor to nearly 580 images.</span><br /><span

      East and Europe, primarily Greece, Italy, and Turkey, from the 10th century BCE through the 6th
      century CE.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 85%;">With a collection of

      Mawr College</a> supports the image needs of several academic departments, including the
      History of Art, Archaeology, Classics, and Growth and Structure of Cities. Within the
      collection, there is a set of approximately 8,000 black-and-white slides depicting
      archaeological and building site plans. These slides reflect Bryn Mawr College's current and
      historical academic strengths in Archaeology and Art History, particularly relating to the
      Classical and Ancient Near East, as well as Medieval Europe. Through a partnership with
      ARTstor, Bryn Mawr College will be contributing several collections to the Digital Library,
