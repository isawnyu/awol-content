      The Academic Database on Historic Jerusalem</a><br /><blockquote

      /></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">The Jerusalem Library, initiated in 2001 by Prof. Sari Nusseibah, President of
      Al-Quds University and Prof. Ronnie Ellenblum of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, is meant
      to be a comprehensive resource for the history of Jerusalem. The library, hosted together by
      the two universities, enables free access to digitized historical materials and primary sources
      about Jerusalem. The collections are based on the archives of the Jewish National Library, the
      Israel Antiquities Authority and the collections of al-Quds University. </span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;">To date, most of the historical sources are kept
      in national, religious, municipal and private archives and are not accessible to all. Physical
      and non-tangible barriers prevent potential readers, in Jerusalem and elsewhere from exploring
      the vast and complicated history of the city. The virtual library is meant to overcome these
      barriers </span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Library makes use
      of innovative content-oriented IT tools and enables a more convenient, home-based search in the
      documents themselves. The biggest part of the collections are books, maps, photographs,
      engravings and inscriptions published for the first time before the beginning of the 20th
      century. </span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The material is
      scanned, OCR'd and thoroughly indexed. The indexing was carried out by a group of Palestinian
      and Israeli students who were supervised by specialists specializing in Classical Languages,
      Arabic and Islamic Studies, Hebrew and Jewish Studies, Geography History and Christianity,
      </span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The basic idea of the library
      is to enable the user to retrieve indexed extracts of various fields. Efforts were made to
      include topics such as gender, feelings, various stages in life, love, war, hatred,
      inter-community relations and other topics which are usually not included in traditional
      indexes. These features will enable the Library users to directly access historical data, thus
      eliminating the external narrator or historian as the interpreter of history.
      </span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Creating such an academic
      unbiased approach to the history of Jerusalem is a challenging task for while Jerusalem is the
      contested capital of two peoples, it is also a spiritual center for each of the world's three
      monotheistic religions and a universal symbol of hope and holiness. Through the Library,
      Jerusalem will be made accessible not only to its own residents and the countries that shoulder
      responsibility for its future, but to the entire world.
