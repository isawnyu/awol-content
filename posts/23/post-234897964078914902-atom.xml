   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://blog.cmog.org/2016/01/05/david-whitehouse-siraf-excavation-notebooks-available-online/">David Whitehouse Sīrāf excavation notebooks available online</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Pearls, gemstones, ivory, and spices are a sampling of the goods traded  in the port city of Sīrāf, located on the east coast of the Persian  Gulf. Sīrāf was a bustling hub of commerce between A.D. 800 and 1050,  serving as a maritime trading center for ships carrying luxury goods to  the Middle East from India, China, South-East Asia, East Africa, and the  Red Sea. Its inhabitants were notably wealthy and their economy thrived  for two centuries until a series of events, including earthquakes, led  to its decline. Between 1966 and 1973 excavations were conducted in  Sīrāf to “learn as much as possible about Sīrāf and its place in the  network of maritime trade described in the literature of the day.” The  excavations were sponsored by the British Institute of Persian Studies  and with full co-operation from the Archaeological Service of Iran.  Eventually the project evolved to investigate “the entire development of  the site from the Sasanian period to the present day.” <a href="http://www.cmog.org/bio/david-whitehouse">Dr. David Whitehouse</a>, former Corning Museum of Glass executive director, was a member of the excavation team.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Museum is excited to announce that the Sīrāf excavation notebooks of  Dr. Whitehouse have been digitized and are available to the public.
