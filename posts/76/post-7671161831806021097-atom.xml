      class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The University of Manchester’s <a
      href="http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/deansgate">John Rylands Library</a> and the
      <a href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/">CuneiformDigital Library Initiative</a> are pleased
      to announce the addition of significant new digital content to CDLI’s web offerings.<br
      /><br />The John Rylands Library houses remarkable and diverse collections of
      manuscripts from many periods and cultures.&nbsp; Among the most important is a substantial
      collection of cuneiform artefacts; with 1164 pieces, it is the third largest collection
      of&nbsp; such material in the UK. The majority of these objects&nbsp; (1030) are
      economic records dating to the Ur III period (ca. 2100-2000 BC) giving a representative view of
      the centralised Babylonian economy at the end of the 3rd millennium BC. Most of these documents
      have previously been known only from early hand copies or catalogues. The collection contains a
      smaller number of earlier documents, most notably 23 administrative texts dating to the Old
      Akkadian period (ca. 2340-2200 BC) and written in a very fine scribal hand.<br /><br
      />In addition, the JRL holds a sizeable collection of Old Babylonian letters. Sumerian
      literature from the same period is represented, among other pieces, by an outstanding
      manuscript of the composition “<a href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/P430840">Gilgamesh and
      Aga</a>”; see also the <a
      href="http://cdli.ox.ac.uk/etcsl/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.1.8.1.1#">University of Oxford’s
      online edition</a>. Finally, the collection contains several royal inscriptions from
      various periods of Mesopotamian history. Most noteworthy are a large cone-shaped inscription of
      the neo-Babylonian king <a href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/P430895">Nebuchadnezzar II (605-562
      BC)</a>; and a fine example of a<br /><a
      href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/P388525">votive inscription by Gudea of the Lagash II dynasty
      (ca. 2100 BC)</a> inscribed on serpentine.<br /><br />All texts were imaged
      by CDLI with conventional photography using High Dynamic Range technology. Some 300 tablets
      have also been imaged using Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) with the assistance of a
      photo dome.&nbsp; For more information on RTI <a
      href="http://culturalheritageimaging.org/Technologies/RTI/">see here</a>.<br
      /><br />Thanks to the cooperation and friendly assistance of the Library’s Special
      Collections staff, the results of the John Rylands Library collaboration have now been added to
      CDLI pages and are viewable at<br />&lt;<a

      Assistant Archivist of the Library; any amendments or comments on the catalogue and associated
      online files should be directed to <a href="mailto:cdli@ucla.edu">CDLI</a>.<br
      /><br />The imaging in Manchester and post-capture processing were undertaken by Klaus
      Wagensonner (University of Oxford) and were made possible by funding from the Andrew W. Mellon
      Foundation. They are part of the<br />on-going mission of CDLI to ensure the long-term
      digital preservation of ancient cuneiform inscriptions, and, in furtherance of humanities
      research, to provide free global access to all available text artefact data.<br /><br
