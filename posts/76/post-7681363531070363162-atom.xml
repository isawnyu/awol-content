    <title type="text">Projects from the UCLA Cultural Virtual Reality Laboratory</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Two interesting projects from the <a
      href="http://www.cvrlab.org/">UCLA Cultural Virtual Reality Laboratory</a> :<br
      /><br /><a href="http://dlib.etc.ucla.edu/projects/Karnak/">Digital
      Karnak</a><br /><p><span
      style="font-size:85%;"></span></p><blockquote><p><span
      style="font-size:85%;">Through at least three thousand years of development, from local
      shrine in a regional town to national center of power, the temple of Amun-Ra at Karnak has
      known dramatic modifications tied in with political shifts, religious reform and ritual
      changes. As a legacy of a culture where every aspect of life was permeated with religion, the
      study of this temple complex touches upon every factor of human existence in ancient Egypt.
      Karnak therefore presents an excellent entry for understanding more about all aspects of
      ancient Egyptian culture and the study of its legacy.</span></p><p><span
      style="font-size:85%;">The Digital Karnak Project aims to make the site of Karnak more
      accessible to students and instructors in the English-speaking world. The features of this
      website have been designed to provide college classrooms (and the interested public) with
      easily accessible, up-to-date, expert material relating to the temple precinct. As part of this
      goal, a 3-D Virtual Reality model of the temple was constructed, offering students a completely
      new way to view the temple: reign-by-reign, following the complex patterns of royal
      construction, modification and destruction that are now obscured by the latest building phases
      at the site. Footage of this model, as well as original videos and maps, are accompanied by
      thematic essays written and reviewed by Egyptologists to supply students and instructors with
      reliable information in a digital and visually dynamic platform. A simplified version of the
      Virtual Reality model of the temple is also made available in Google Earth, for a completely
      interactive experience.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:85%;">A
      team of noted Egyptologists, educators, architects, and technologists were brought together to
      develop learning resources related to the Temple at Karnak in Egypt. The project had three
      primary goals: (1) to assemble databases of information related to Karnak, (2) build an
      interactive computer model of the site, and (3) create a series of resources using the model
      and databases that are available online free-of-charge through this website and can be easily
      used for undergraduate education.</span></p><p><span
      style="font-size:85%;">The Digital Karnak Project combines the experience and talent of two
      sections of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA): the Experiential Technologies
      Center (ETC) and the UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology (UEE). Directed by Dr. Diane Favro through
      the School of the Arts and Architecture with support from UCLAâ€™s Academic Technology Services,
      the ETC uses powerful information technology tools to support creative and cross-disciplinary
      research in archaeology, architecture, humanities, social sciences, and the performing arts.
      Dr. Willeke Wendrich of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures is director of
      the UCLA Digital Humanities Incubator Group (UDHIG) and the editor-in-chief of the online UCLA
      Encyclopedia of Egyptology (UEE), a repository for scholarly content related to
      Egypt.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:85%;">The Digital Karnak
      Project was funded in part with a grant from the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/"
      target="_blank">National Endowment of the Humanities (NEH)</a>. Financial assistance
      was also provided by the Steinmetz Family Trust. Staff assistance and computing infrastructure
      was provided by UCLA's Institute for Digital Research and Education (IDRE) and UCLA's Academic
      Technology Services (ATS).</span></p></blockquote><p><span
      style="font-size:85%;"></span></p><br /><br /><a
      href="http://dlib.etc.ucla.edu/projects/Forum/">Digital Roman Forum</a><br
      /><p><span
      style="font-size:85%;"></span></p><blockquote><p><span
      style="font-size:85%;">From 1997 to 2003 the <a href="http://www.cvrlab.org/">Cultural
      Virtual Reality Laboratory</a> (CVRLab) created a digital model of the Roman Forum as it
      appeared in late antiquity. The notional date of the model is June 21, 400
      A.D.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:85%;">The purpose of the
      modeling project was to spatialize information and theories about how the Forum looked at this
      moment in time, which was more or less the height of its development as Rome's civic and
      cultural center. The digital model includes over twenty features (buildings and major
      monuments) filling up the western zone of the Roman Forum from the Temple of Vesta and Temple
      of Antoninus and Faustina on the east to the Tabularium facing the western slope of the
      Capitoline Hill.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:85%;">Thanks to
      archaeological campaigns that started in the early nineteenth century and which continue to the
      present day, these features can be seen in Rome today and constitute one of the city's most
      important archaeological sites. Their state of preservation varies from fair to poor; and the
      ruins seen today represent a mixture of different phases in the life of the Forum. As a result,
      understanding the Forum is a challenging task not only for tourists but also for scholars.
      Almost as soon as the new excavations started bringing the ancient remains to light,
      archaeologists such as Canina, Huelsen, Gatteschi, and Gismondi started to create graphic and
      physical reconstructions of how the Forum might have looked at specific moments in time. The
      CVRLab digital model, created with the help of an international Scientific Advisory Committee,
      is the latest example of this perennial project.</span></p><p><span
      style="font-size:85%;">From the time the modeling project was conceived, the investigators
      intended to present their results to students, scholars and the general public. The digital
      model of the Forum can be viewed on various hardware and software platforms. These range from
      simple static views that can be displayed on a computer monitor to dedicated visualization
      theaters costs hundreds of thousands of dollars or
      more.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:85%;">With generous support
      from the National Science Foundation, the CVRLab was able to create this Web site about the
      digital Forum model from 2002 to 2005. The purposes of this site are: (1) to use the Internet
      to permit free use and easy viewing of the digital model by people all over the world; (2) to
      provide documentation for the archaeological evidence and theories utilized to create the
      model; and (3) to offer basic information about the individual features comprising the digital
      model so that their history and cultural context can be readily
      understood.</span></p></blockquote><!-- AddThis Button BEGIN --><br
