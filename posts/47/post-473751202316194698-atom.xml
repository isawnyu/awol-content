      </blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">Having most
      relevance for research in Archaeology, History, Politics and Travel, the books and papers of
      Gertrude Bell (1868-1926) were given to Newcastle University Library by Gertrude's half-sister,
      Lady Richmond, although part of the Doughty-Wylie correspondence came from St. Anthony's
      College, Oxford. They are under the care of the Special Collections department, which can be
      contacted at: lib-specenq@ncl.ac.uk.</span><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The
      Gertrude Bell Collection comprises books on Arabic and Persian languages and on the histories
      of Arabia, and the Near and Middle East which were formerly part of Gertrude's working library.
      These can be found in the Library's online catalogue.</span>
      </blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">The
      Papers</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Gertrude Bell Papers
      comprise Gertrude's personal correspondence, diaries and miscellaneous items, such as Review of
      the Civil Administration of Mesopotamia (1920), notebooks, obituaries, lecture notes and
      miscellaneous reports, memoranda and cuttings. Circa. 1,600 letters and diaries covering the
      years 1877-1879 and 1893-1900 (with some gaps reflecting where we do not have the hard-copy
      diary) can be found transcribed on this website, along with c.7,000 of her archaeological and
      travel photographs. (The photographic portion of the Gertrude Bell archive is administered by
      the School of Historical Studies.) Neither letters to and from army officer Charles
      Doughty-Wylie (written 1913-1915) nor any of the Miscellaneous materials have been transcribed
      although a handlist to the Miscellaneous part of the collection is available</span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Gertrude Bell (1868-1926)</span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Gertrude Margaret Lowthian Bell was born into a wealthy family
      at Washington New Hall in what was then County Durham. Initially home-schooled, she then
      attended school in London and graduated with a first-class degree in Modern History from Oxford
      University. Thereafter she travelled in Europe and also spent several months in Bucharest and
      in Tehran. Her travels continued with two round-the-world trips: one in 1897-1898 and one in
      1902-1903.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br
      /></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">From the turn of the
      century, Gertrude developed a love of the Arab peoples - she learned their languages,
      investigated their archaeological sites and travelled deep into the desert. This intimate
      knowledge of the country and its tribes made her a target of British Intelligence recruitment
      during the First World War. At the end of the war, Gertrude focussed on the future of
      Mesopotamia and was to become a powerful force in Iraqi politics, becoming a kingmaker when her
      preferred choice, Faisal (son of Husain, the Sharif of Mecca and King of the Hijaz) was crowned
      King of the state of Iraq in August 1921.</span><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Gertrude's first love remained archaeology and, as Honorary Director of
      Antiquities in Iraq, she established the Iraq Museum in Baghdad. Her 1905 expedition through
      the Syrian Desert to Asia Minor was published as The Desert and the Sown and her study, in
      1907, of Binbirkilise on the Kara Dag mountain was published as The Thousand and One Churches
      and remains the standard work on early Byzantine architecture in Anatolia.
