   <title type="text">Agade List Archives</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sbl-site.org/agade.html">Agade List Archive at the SBL</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="about">About the Agade Mailing List</a><br />&nbsp; <br />Jack M. Sasson, the Mary Jane Werthan Professor of Judaic and Biblical Studies at Vanderbilt University, has been collecting and distributing the Agade Mailing List for almost two decades, dating back to his position at The University of North Carolina, which still hosts the email distribution list. The Agade list forwards news and information of interest to scholars in biblical studies, Near Eastern studies, Late Antiquity, Judaica, Classics, archaeology, and even broad intellectual history. It is a valuable source of announcements, and these many guilds are in debt to Professor Sasson.<br /><br />The Society of Biblical Literature has permission to collect these postings and to archive them. The Current Postings include  announcements from the previous day. The Archive includes all prior announcements and will  eventually date back to 2010. SBL does not supplement, eliminate, or  otherwise emend the number or content of the announcements, and presents them in the order of their delivery.</span></blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/bibelorient">Agade&nbsp; List Archive on Twitter</a><br />14,965 postings from Agade (as of 30 September 2016) are archived dating back to July 2011.<br /><br /><br />To subscribe to Agade by email please send a blank email to listserv@unc.edu, and write (as subject and in first line): subscribe agade]]></content>
