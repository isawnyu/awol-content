   <title type="text">Glassware and Ceramic Museum of Iran</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.glasswaremuseum.ir/"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #333333;">Glassware and Ceramic Museum of Iran</span></span></span></a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: #333333;">The premises that have been turned into museum where glass and clay works are    on display were built about 90 years ago upon orders of <i><b>Ahmad Qavam</b>    <b>(Qavam-ol-Saltaneh</b></i><b>)</b> for his personal lodging (residence and    working office). The building is situated in a garden with a span of 7000 square    meters and was used  by    Qavam himself till the year 1953.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: #333333;"><br />  Later, the building were sold to the Egyptians as the new premises for the embassy    of Egypt and remained in their possession for seven years. When relations were    strained between Iran and Egypt at the time of Abdul Nasser and subsequent to    the closure of the Egyptian embassy in Iran, the Commercial Bank purchased the    building.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: #333333;"><br />  However, it was sold to Farah Pahlaviâ€™s bureau in 1976 and was turned into a    museum by three groups of Iranian, Austrian and French architects. The museum    was opened in 1980 and was registered in the list of national heritage in 1998.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: #333333;"><br />  The main establishment of the museum that occupies an area of 1040 square meters    is a two-storey octagonal building with suspended pillars and a basement. It    is situated on the entrance side of the premises. The architectural style of    the building is a combination of the traditional Iranian style and the European    architecture of the 19th century.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: #333333;"><br />  The first floor is connected to the second one through wooden steps in Russian    style. Prior to the time when the building was transferred into the Egyptian    embassy, the entrance of the museum was doomed-shaped but was later flattened.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />  Parts of the walls in the basement are decorated in traditional style with big    tiles. Double windows have been used in the architecture of the building instead    of terrace and wooden doors have been installed behind the windowpanes in order    to regulate the light and temperature of the interior of the building. The exterior    and interior of the museum comprise such decorations as brick works, plaster    works, mirror works and inlaid works. </span></span></span></span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">         <br /><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width: 163px;"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><br /></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#000000">        <td colspan="2" height="50"><img height="38" src="http://www.glasswaremuseum.ir/IMAGES/title.jpg" width="166" /></td>    </tr><tr>        <td height="30"><img height="19" src="http://www.glasswaremuseum.ir/IMAGES/flesh.gif" width="19" /></td>      <td height="30"><img border="0" height="19" src="http://www.glasswaremuseum.ir/IMAGES/k-history1.jpg" width="132" /></td>    </tr><tr>        <td height="30">&nbsp;</td>      <td height="30"><a href="http://www.glasswaremuseum.ir/visitor.htm"><img border="0" height="21" src="http://www.glasswaremuseum.ir/IMAGES/k-visitor1.jpg" width="105" /></a></td>    </tr><tr>        <td height="30">&nbsp;</td>      <td height="30"><a href="http://www.glasswaremuseum.ir/object/object.htm"><img border="0" height="20" src="http://www.glasswaremuseum.ir/IMAGES/k-obj1.jpg" width="60" /></a></td>    </tr><tr>        <td height="30">&nbsp;</td>      <td height="30"><a href="http://www.glasswaremuseum.ir/virtual/virtual.htm"><img border="0" height="19" src="http://www.glasswaremuseum.ir/IMAGES/k-virtual1.jpg" width="85" /></a></td>    </tr><tr>        <td height="30">&nbsp;</td>      <td height="30"><a href="http://www.glasswaremuseum.ir/information.htm"><img border="0" height="20" src="http://www.glasswaremuseum.ir/IMAGES/k-info1.jpg" width="144" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><br />]]></content>
