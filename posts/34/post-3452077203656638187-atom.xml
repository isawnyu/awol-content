   <title type="text">Classical Receptions in Drama and Poetry in English from c.1970 to the Present: Poetry Database (Pilot Version1) </title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/PoetryDB/intro.htm">Classical Receptions in Drama and Poetry in English from c.1970 to the Present: Poetry Database (Pilot Version1)</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Poetry Strand : Introduction </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">      <span style="font-size: x-small;">Lorna Hardwick (2007) </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">      <span style="font-size: x-small;">Recent poetry in English has a special role to play in  researching the role of the past in the human experience of the present  and in redirecting investigation to the classical texts and contexts and  their interaction with those of the present. Poetry both stands  independently as a strand in the Project and contributes to the drama  research because of the significance of theatre poetry. It also enables  comparison of poetry written for both public and private readings and  readerships. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">      <span style="font-size: x-small;">The poetry strand of the research project considers the  treatment of Greek and Roman texts and themes in poetry in English in  the last part of the twentieth century and the early part of the twenty  first. As with drama, we are not rigid about dates but will follow the  evidence and the argument where it leads. Material analysed so far  suggests that we need to consider poetry written from about 1960  onwards. As with drama, the importance of the creative response is  evident at all levels and ranges from Nobel Prize winners such as Derek  Walcott and Seamus Heaney to regional and community poetic activity. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">      <span style="font-size: x-small;">The variety of poetic registers and genres suggests a  paradoxical relationship to the modernist poetry of the earlier  twentieth century as well as to earlier classical receptions, thus  provoking research questions about the intersections between different  literary and cultural traditions and the relationship of classical  referents to the sometimes partly classicized traditions in which the  modern writing is embedded (for discussion of this in relation to  earlier poetry in English, see K. Haynes, <em>English Literature and Ancient Languages, </em> Oxford, 2003.) </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">      </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">How Greek and Roman culture has been introduced, reworked and  rewritten in contemporary poetry is not confined to the reception of the  Greek and Latin texts themselves but also includes ancient artistic and  material culture, themes, figures and myths. Genres include epic,  lyric, parody, satire, dramatic monologues, film-poems, performance  poetry and theatre poetry...</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/PoetryDB/intro.htm">An Introduction</a><br />                      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" style="width: 100%px;"><tbody><tr><td class="style10 style11"><br /></td></tr><tr>            <td class="style12">            Case Study <a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/PoetryDB/longley/poetrylongleyintro.htm"> Michael Longley</a><br />             <br />            <br />             </td>          </tr><tr>            <td class="style8 style11">            Database Entries<br />              Pilot Sample:<br />             <a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/PoetryDB/Boland/Bolandintro.htm">Eavan Boland</a><br />             <a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/PoetryDB/Broumas/broumasintro.htm">Olga Broumas</a><br />             <a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/PoetryDB/hughes/hughesintro.htm">Ted Hughes</a><br />             <a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/PoetryDB/longley/longlelyintro.htm">Michael Longley</a><br />             </td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"></blockquote>]]></content>
