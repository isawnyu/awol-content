    <title type="text">Brooklyn Museum Image Collections</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[On January 8th 2009 the Brooklyn Museum issued more than 4000 new images
      from their <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/archives/" title="Libraries
      and Archives" target="_blank">Libraries and Archives</a> Department to the web. These
      join the 5700+ works of art and the nearly 10,000 views of past exhibitions they have already
      published online.<br /><br />Among the images they've published is a selection,
      <a
      href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/archives/lantern_slide_collection">almost
      all of Egypt</a>, from their collection of 11,710 glass lantern slides:<br
      /><blockquote>In 1849, the Philadelphia daguerreotypists William and Frederick
      Langenheim introduced the lantern slide: a transparent image on glass that could be projected,
      in magnified form, onto a surface using a "magic lantern," or sciopticon. This new technology
      expanded the uses of photography, allowing photographic images to be viewed by a large
      audience. With lantern slides, Museum curators and educators could illustrate their lectures,
      letting audience members see detailed studies of objects and sites from around the world.<br
      /><br />The Brooklyn Museum's lantern slide collection was started by the Museum's
      curator of fine arts, William Henry Goodyear, in the late nineteenth century. With the
      assistance of the photographers Joseph Hawkes and John McKecknie, Goodyear reproduced images of
      archaeological and architectural sites in Europe as well as images of the Paris Exposition,
      which Hawkes often hand-colored for more realistic effect. The lantern slide collection also
      developed through the efforts of the curator of ethnology, Stewart Culin, and his successor
      Herbert Spinden, who created and purchased images of objects and sites. Historical images of
      Museum galleries, New York City scenes, and buildings also became part of the collection. In
      1921, a significant addition of 118 boxes of slides, originally the property of Franklin
      Hooper, Director of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, was consigned to the Museum,
      the Children's Museum, and the Botanic Garden.<br /><br />With the introduction of
      smaller transparencies in the 1950s, the use of lantern slides declined. The glass slides have
      remained quite valuable, however, because they depict scenes, people, and events from an
      earlier time, as well as sites and objects that simply no longer exist.<br /><br
      />The Museum's Library now holds 11,710 glass lantern slides, which were selected from the
      extensive lantern slide collection in 1990. At that time, archives staff conducted an initial
      evaluation and sorting project identifying several categories to be excluded from the
      collection. Among the excluded categories were reproductions from books, non-Brooklyn Museum
      objects, and items from natural history and general history. Ten years later, the Goodyear
      lantern slides were cataloged and scanned as part of the Goodyear Archival Collection. In 2005,
      archives staff produced a detailed content and condition survey of the balance of the lantern
      slide collection.<br /><br />Of the original collection of 11,710 glass lantern
      slides, 3,093 have already been catalogued and scanned as part of the Goodyear Archival
      Collection. The non-Goodyear slides have been surveyed and described in the current project.
      Some of the slides were commercially produced; others appear to have been made by Museum or
      Brooklyn Institute staff. Some were hand-colored. The images have been organized into several
      broad sections or series, including "Brooklyn Museum," "Native Americans," and "Views." The two
      largest series of images are "Views: Objects, Egypt" and "Views: Italy."</blockquote>They
      have also released a selection of <a
      href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/archives/set/72/collection_of_photographs_by_alfred_p._maudslay_1883-1890.">photographs
      by Alfred P. Maudslay, 1883-1890</a>:<br /><blockquote>English archaeologist
      and photographer Alfred Percival Maudslay (1850â€“1931) first visited Central America in 1872
      after being inspired by the images he saw in Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas,
      and Yucatan by John Lloyd Stephens. The "unexpected magnificence of the monuments" in the
      tropical forests captivated Maudslay, who then dedicated his life to documenting ruins found in
      Mexico and Central America. Maudslay played a crucial role in exploring and documenting ancient
      Mayan ruins found in several sites including Palenque, Copan, and Chichen Itza. Between 1881
      and 1894, he conducted arduous explorations in remote areas, carrying his photographic
      equipment, casting plaster, and other supplies to make careful photographic records and plaster
      casts of architectural ruins. When he returned to England he published his findings in a
      multi-volume set entitled Biologia Centrali-Americana and made exhibition prints from his glass
      plate negatives that were shown at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. It was
      in Chicago that Brooklyn Museum founding curators Stewart Culin and William Henry Goodyear saw
      the prints and arranged to purchase them, along with the Biologia for the Brooklyn Museum. The
      photographs and the multi-volume book remain an essential foundation for Maya studies, offering
      thorough views of the architectural ruins along with details of hieroglyphs carved into the
      monuments. In the face of wide-scale looting that has imperiled the historical record,
      researchers have turned to Maudslay's photographs, his plaster casts, and his books to better
      understand Mayan writing and architecture.</blockquote>The Brooklyn Museum permits users
      to <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/tag_game/start.php">tag
      photographs</a> they have online. I encourage readers to join in and assist in
      documenting these collections. And it is not just old photographs you can tag, but <a
      href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/collections/">every object</a> they
      have made available online]]></content>
