To some it will cause surprise that such material should need study. Not so to                                     					the archaeologist or the historian, who often has had reason to be grateful for                                     					the data supplied by coin finds. The presentation of some of the causes of                                     					hoarding and of the deductions we may draw from recovered buried treasure is                                     					submitted that the value of some of these results may be made clearer. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">                                                                 <span style="font-size: x-small;">We Americans, probably because we are without many opportunities of such a nature                                     					this side of the water, find this subject of especial interest. To be sure, the                                     					treasuries of the Incas of Peru which  have been unearthed included the precious                                     					metals in many forms but nothing that has been identified as currency. The                                     					tumuli of the Maya and Aztec civilizations of Central America                                     					will some day yield rich returns to the investigator, but the material                                     					heretofore secured is archaeological or ethnological, and, like that of Peru,                                     					has included little of a numismatic nature. In both cases, the finds are more                                     					closely analogous to those of ancient Egypt where the                                     					accounts often prove more thrilling than fiction. It stimulates the imagination                                     					to read of unrifled tombs where lie haughty princesses of long ago. Their jewels                                     					and the implements of their daily life were placed near at hand in readiness for                                     					the after-world, but food and drink were considered more necessary than gold.                                     					Only with the burials of the later and least interesting period does numismatic                                     					material occur. This is owing to the fact that the early money of the Egyptians                                     					consisted of bullion in an unminted form whose exchange value was determined by                                     					weight. During the Per-  sian domination, the darics and sigloi of                                     					the invaders seem to have been in use to a limited degree, but finds show also                                     					that the early coinage of the Greeks circulated to a much more considerable                                     					extent. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">                                                                 </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Although finds of coin do not occur in this country as frequently as in Europe, one of the basic causes of these burials,                                     					hoarding, is not so foreign to our experience as might be supposed. Only when a                                     					hoard has been buried is there a chance of its becoming treasure trove and we                                     					are not accustomed to burying our savings. Civilization has accustomed us to                                     					other means of safekeeping, and experience has approved them satisfactory. In                                     					the cities, our savings are placed in banks or safe deposits. Let there be a run                                     					on the bank, however, and we see a return to primitive conditionsâ€”deposits are                                     					withdrawn as quickly as possible; and until confidence in some other institution                                     					overcomes the distrust caused by the failure, money is hoarded just as carefully                                     					as it was in the time of the Greeks and Romans. When we turn from a section                                     					remote from city  life, to districts far removed from the                                     					conveniences which civilization affords, there is little difference from the                                     					procedure of the Ancients. Among the miners, hiding gold-dust becomes a                                     					necessity. So even to-day hoarding is not as exceptional a thing as it is                                     					thought.                                 </span><br /></blockquote></div></div></div></div>]]></content>
