    <title type="text">Cairo Genizah Collection of the Bodleian libraries</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://genizah.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/home">Genizah:<span
      class="lang-en" lang="en"> Cairo Genizah Collection of the Bodleian
      libraries</span></a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div
      class="about"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The collection of Cairo Genizah
      fragments held at the Bodleian Libraries is one of major collections of its kind. Acquired over
      the years since 1890 it consists of about 4,000 fragments. Skilful selection ensured that the
      Bodleian Genizah holdings became one of the most important collections worldwide, featuring
      Bible, Early Rabbinic literature (Midrash, Mishnah and Talmud), numerous liturgical fragments
      (Piyyutim and Selichot), many legal documents and letters, both personal and commercial. Its
      significance lies particularly in the remarkable size of many of the documents. The 4000
      fragments comprise about 25,000 pages, amounting to over six pages per fragment, an average
      unparalleled elsewhere. Some items consist of whole quires, thus deserving the designation
      manuscripts rather than fragments. Talmud fragments of ten pages or more are no exception in
      this collection: Tractate Berakhot is represented with a manuscript of 32 pages (Ms. Heb. c.
      17/32); of tractate Sukkah 72 pages (Ms. Heb. e 51) are preserved and for tractate Sotah we
      have 160 pages (Ms. Heb. d. 20/2) at our disposal. An exceptionally exciting example are the
      twenty pages of Maimonides’s draft manuscript of his Mishneh Torah with corrections in 4
      consecutive stages in his own hand (Ms. Heb. d 32,
      fols.47a-56b).</span></div><div class="about"><br /></div><div
      class="about"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The online catalogue is based upon the
      printed catalogue of the Hebrew manuscripts in the Bodleian Library (second volume) by Adolf
      Neubauer and Arthur Ernst Cowley (1906) and the typewritten catalogue of additional Genizah
      fragments by Arthur Ernst Cowley (ca 1929).&nbsp;</span></div><div
      class="about"><br /></div><div class="about"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">The classification of the fragments by subject in the printed catalogue in line
      with the first volume of Neubauer’s catalogue of Hebrew manuscripts at the Bodleian library is
      - as mentioned in the introduction by Arthur Cowley - problematic. Fragments from the Cairo
      Genizah were collected by the Bodleian Library in successive acquisitions, which after arrival
      were bound up in volumes. As a consequence volumes often, despite a careful and focussed
      acquisition policy, contain under one heading fragments on different subjects. In the online
      catalogue all fragments of a volume can be searched by subject. The printed catalogue includes
      166 volumes, containing in all about 2,675 fragments. The typewritten catalogue consists of 58
      volumes with 1094 fragments. It is to be noticed, however, that the total number of 3769
      fragments concerns those of which the Cairo Genizah provenance explicitly is stated. The
      digital access to the Bodleian Genizah collection will facilitate the identification of a
      considerable number of fragments, whose provenance were hitherto unknown, but which probably
      also found their way from Cairo to Oxford.
