    <content type="html"><![CDATA[At the <a href="http://www.asor.org/am/index.html">ASOR Members
      Meeting and Awards</a> on Friday November 20, 2009, Sarah Whitcher Kansa announced the
      winners of this year's <a
      href="http://www.alexandriaarchive.org/events.php?newsid=56">ASOR Open Archaeology
      Prize</a>.<br /><br /><p><strong><span
      style=";font-family:Times;color:black;" >First Prize</span></strong><span
      style=";font-family:Times;color:black;" >: $500</span></p><p><a
      href="http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/wbarc/">The West Bank and East Jerusalem Searchable
      Map</a><span style="font-size:85%;"><br
      /></span></p><p><span style="font-size:85%;"><blockquote>This
      collection includes lists of archaeological sites that have been surveyed or excavated since
      Israel occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967. Since that time, the oversight of the
      antiquities of the area has devolved on two government bodies: the military administration's
      Staff Officer for Archaeology (SOA) in Judea and Samaria and the Israel Antiquities Authority
      (IAA). The IAA, which is responsible for East Jerusalem, is a civil branch of government and
      its records are open for inspection. Some of the records of the Staff Officer for Archaeology
      in Judea and Samaria are being accessed in full for the first time as a result of the joint
      Israeli-Palestinian Archaeology Working Group. This involved a team of Israeli and a team of
      Palestinian archaeologists and cultural heritage professionals working in concert to create new
      data resources that document the single, unitary archaeological landscape of the southern
      Levant, which is now bisected by the modern borders.

      style="font-size:85%;"><strong>Great Temple Excavation
      Database:</strong></span></p><span style="font-size:85%;"> This project
      represents the comprehensive results of Brown University excavations at Petra's Great Temple
      from 1993 - 2006.<br /><br />About the Great Temple: The Great Temple contains
      eclectic exquisite art and architecture from the Nabataean period and demonstrates that the
      values of the Nabataeans of Petra during this period who felt that aesthetic decoration of
      structures with frescos and architectural sculpture was sufficiently significant on which to
      expend time, money and energy. This blending of different cultures is seen in this palatial
      building and its precinct with the use of elephant heads, frescos, elegantly carved pilasters
      and capitals. There is a high level of skill and technology possessed by her builders as well
      as the high level of organized government that would be needed to plan the building of this
      monumental structure. The Great Temple is one of the key sites in the Nabataean Petra, and it
      is a significant site for our knowledge of the development of Petra. The lives of the
      Nabataeans were influenced by a unique blend of cultures. The study of the Great Temple is
      essential to the understanding of many different aspects of the archaeology of Petra. Such an
      interpretation when considered in relation to what is known about other Nabataean sites can
      effectively enrich the web of knowledge we possess regarding both Petra and the people whose
      lives ultimately created it. Each of our seasons of excavation has proved to be provocative and
      propitious as many questions were raised and many extraordinary artifacts were recovered.

      prize ($500) was awarded to the <a href="http://www.etana.org/abzu/">Abzu web
      site</a>, led by Charles E. Jones, Head Librarian at the <a
      href="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw">Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York
      University</a> and Research Associate, <a href="http://oi.uchicago.edu/">The

      manages open access scholarly material relating to the ancient Near East and Mediterranean
      world, including the rich corpus of ETANA Core Texts, which are available for free for
      noncommercial teaching and research. In addition to standard search functions, Abzu provides
      several different ways to track recently entered material, such as <a
      href="http://www.etana.org/abzu/rss/">news feeds</a>, a <a
      href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/AbzuNew">clip blog</a> and a <a
      href="http://www.widgetbox.com/widget/abzu-bibliography">widget</a>. It also allows
      for the re-presentation and re-formatting of material indexed in it in the continuing series
      "AWOL - The Ancient World Online", beginning at the <a

      <p><span style="font-size:100%;">Second prize ($200 in books, co-sponsored by the
      <a href="http://www.oxbowbooks.com/home.cfm/Location/DBBC">David Brown Book
      Company</a>) was awarded to the <a href="http://www.bade.psr.edu/">Badè Museum of
      Archaeology web site</a>, led by Aaron Brody (Pacific School of Religion). The Badè
      Museum’s web site was recently overhauled to allow for virtual outreach to a limitless
      audience, helping educate beyond the brick-and-mortar walls of the Museum's galleries, and
      bringing transparency to the Museum’s holdings. The web site provides access to reusable
      content from archaeological excavations at Tell en-Nasbeh, conducted by WF Bade in the 1920s
      and 1930s under the auspices of Pacific School of Religion. The new web site provides digital
      versions of the contents in the Museum’s exhibits, overviews of research projects and
      facilitates the ordering of traveling exhibit materials. By openly licensing all content with
      Creative Commons licenses, the Bade team has ensured that these free and open resources can be
      downloaded for reuse by anyone. The photographs and short movies are of particular interest,
      and Aaron informs us that many more resources will be coming on line in the near
      future.</span></p> <span style="font-size:100%;"><br /><br

      style="font-size:100%;"> Scholars from UC Berkeley swept the Open Archaeology Prize
      competition, held at the 2007 meeting of the <a href="http://www.asor.org/">American
      Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR)</a>. One of a series of awards around “open
      archaeology” funded primarily by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, this particular Open
      Archaeology Prize targeted members of ASOR, a long-standing organization of archaeologists
      conducting research in the Near East. The winners, who were selected based on their project’s
      scholarly merit, potential for reuse in research or teaching and availability on the web in a
      free and reusable format, were announced last week at ASOR’s annual meeting in San Diego.
      </span></p> <p> </p><p class="subHeader"><span
      style="font-size:100%;"> First Prize, Senior Scholar</span></p><span
      style="font-size:100%;"> First prize for a Senior Scholar was awarded to the team led by
      <a href="http://ls.berkeley.edu/dept/anth/tringham.html">Ruth Tringham </a>
      (Professor, Department of Anthropology) and <a
      href="http://okapi.wordpress.com/people/noah-wittman/"> Noah Wittman</a> (Program
      Manager, ) for their website <a
      href="http://okapi.dreamhosters.com/remixing/mainpage.html">“Remixing Çatalhöyük”
      </a>(http://okapi.dreamhosters.com/remixing/mainpage.html). Remixing Çatalhöyük has been
      variously described as a database narrative and as a multimedia exhibition and research
      archive. Launched in October 2007, it features the investigations and data of the Berkeley
      Archaeologists at Çatalhöyük (BACH) and their colleagues at the Neolithic tell settlement of
      Çatalhöyük, Turkey. The aim of the website, accessible in English or Turkish, is to engage the
      public of all ages in the exploration of primary research data through four themed collections
      that are selected from the research database. One theme on the Life-History of People, Places,
      and Things - also includes a K-12 activity module. The public are invited to download media
      items that are licensed with a Creative Commons 3.0 license, create original projects and
      contribute their own "remixes" about Çatalhöyük. Tringham and Wittman write that the developers
      of this resource “hope that this project will inspire other researchers to openly share their
      research data and engage broad public audiences.” Remixing Çatalhöyük represents a
      groundbreaking effort toward sharing and elucidating the past, and we certainly hope other
      projects will follow their lead. </span><p> </p><p
      class="subHeader"><span style="font-size:100%;"> First Prize, Junior
      Scholar</span></p><span style="font-size:100%;"> First prize for a Junior
      Scholar was awarded to Catherine Foster (PhD student, Department of Near Eastern Studies) for
      her project <a href="http://nes.berkeley.edu/%7Ecpfoster/">“Household Archaeology and the
      Uruk Phenomenon: A Case Study from Kenan Tepe, Turkey”</a>
      (http://nes.berkeley.edu/~cpfoster/). Catherine is awarded first place for developing a website
      on her research involving household studies of a Late Chalcolithic community in the Upper
      Tigris region of southeast Anatolia. Foster explains that the ultimate goal of this project is
      to create an open access micro-artifact database that can be used as a reference resource for
      other scholars wishing to embark on this type of analysis. Because it will be open access,
      other scholars will be able to add to the database with high-resolution scans and descriptions
      or alter categories as developments are made. She states, “To my knowledge, no such database is
      freely available over the Internet and will be a valuable resource as the inclusion of
      microarchaeological techniques in Near Eastern excavation projects becomes more and more
      commonplace.” Foster’s project demonstrates a solid foundation in open access and a visionary
      approach for future sharing of research in archaeology. </span><p> </p><p
      class="subHeader"><span style="font-size:100%;"> Runner
      Up</span></p><span style="font-size:100%;"> A second prize of $200 in books,
      co-sponsored by the David Brown Book Company, was awarded to Justin Lev-Tov (Statistical
      Research, Inc.) for his project <a
      href="http://www.opencontext.org/database/project.php?item=HazorZooPRJ0000000010"> “Hazor:
      Zooarchaeology”</a>
      (http://www.opencontext.org/database/project.php?item=HazorZooPRJ0000000010). This project
      presents zooarchaeological identification and analysis of nearly 10,000 animal bones from Late
      Bronze Age and Iron Age contexts at Hazor, research Justin conducted as part of the Hazor
      Excavations in memory of Yigael Yadin. By sharing this dataset in Open Context with a flexible
      license for reuse, Justin is improving access to high-quality research and original data that
      accompany published syntheses. This dataset has been accessed over 11,000 times since it was
      uploaded to Open Context in Fall 2006. We hope to see more related content from this time
      period available in open access formats so that Justin’s dataset becomes even more valuable
      through comparison with other sites. </span><p><span style="font-size:100%;">
      The ASOR Open Archaeology Prize competition is sponsored by the Alexandria Archive Institute,
      promoting the development and use of open educational resources in archaeology and related
      disciplines. The competition aims to enhance community recognition of open scholarly
      communication and receives generous support from the <a
