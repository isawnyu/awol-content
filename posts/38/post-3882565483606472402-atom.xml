      x-small;"></span><ul><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a
      href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Logeion</a> (literally, a place
      for words; in particular, <a
      href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%B5%E1%BF%96%CE%BF%CE%BD"
      target="_blank">a speaker's platform</a>, or an <a
      href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu/index.html#logeum" target="_blank">archive</a>) was
      developed after the example of <a href="http://dvlf.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank"
      title="">dvlf.uchicago.edu</a>, to provide simultaneous lookup of entries in the many
      reference works that make up the Perseus Classical collection. As always, we are grateful for
      the Perseus Project's generosity in sharing their data. None of this would be possible without
      their commitment to open access. To improve the chronological range for which the dictionaries
      are useful, we have added DuCange (see below), and to enhance this site as both a research and
      a pedagogical tool, we add information based on corpus data in the right side bar, as well as
      references to chapters in standard textbooks. More such 'widgets' will be added over time,
      along with, we hope, still more dictionaries.</span> </li><div
      style="padding-right: 72px; padding-top: 0px; text-align: justify;">
      </div><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>Update December
      2013:</b>We are delighted to announce that we are adding the premier dictionary for
      Ancient Greek, the <a href="http://dge.cchs.csic.es/">Diccionario Griego-Español
      (DGE)</a>, to Logeion. Both for entries from DGE and from DuCange, we will include a link
      to these dictionaries' home sites for every entry we display. As we work on displaying these
      entries better, we recommend (also) visiting the home sites, which look positively elegant.
      This update also brings the Latin-Dutch dictionary, LaNe, up to date with the printed 6th
      edition, which will be coming out soon. </span></li><li><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Update October 2013: Logeion is now available as an <a
      href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu/about-logeion-ios.html">app for iOS</a>, so that you
      can consult it even without a working internet connection. Find the <a
      href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/logeion/id727860177?mt=8">Logeion app</a> in
      Apple's app store.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Update January 2012: We have now added a Latin-Dutch dictionary to the collection:
      The <i>Woordenboek Latijn/Nederlands.</i> One notable feature of this dictionary,
      for those who do not speak Dutch, is that a lot of attention has been paid to ensure accuracy
      of vowel length for the lexical entries. For further information see below. <br
      /></span> </li></ul><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"></span><h2 style="font-family: 'Gill sans','Trebuchet
      MS',Helvetica,Tahoma,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Using
      ΛΟΓΕΙΟΝ</span></h2><span style="font-size: x-small;">
      </span><ul><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Learning to use
      Logeion to look up words should be straightforward. Start typing in (the first few letters of)
      the headword (or lemma) for the entry (transliteration is an option for Greek words) and the
      word wheel will spin to what we hope will be the right destination. Enter a minimum of three
      characters, and the system will attempt to suggest entries in the neighborhood. <br
      /></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Details,
      details: When you are typing in a word, Logeion will consult its database and suggest Greek or
      Latin lookalikes. If you are typing in transliterated Greek, pick the suggested Greek word when
      it appears in the drop down menu. If you simply hit enter (or click on the 'Go' button) after
      typing 'logos', the system will take your input literally, and direct you to the entry for
      'logos' in the Latin dictionaries. Note that the system is a rather poor student of the Greek
      alphabet - words in the suggestion list will not quite show up in the order you expect. <br
      /></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">If you are
      trying to determine the right dictionary entry for an inflected word, you have two options.
      Simply start typing the first few characters, and Logeion might already direct you correctly.
      But when things get more complicated, you can type in the complete word (for Greek, this
      requires full diacritics). <br /></span></li><li><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">If the word occurs as an inflected word in our database, Logeion
      will suggest a lemma or lemmas for it. You can hover over the lemma to see its choice of
      parses. Double-clicking on words within the dictionary entries and example sentences will allow
      you to go to the entry for that word - provided that the database has the right parse, of
      course, or that by happenstance, it lands you in the right position in the alphabet.
