    <title type="text">ISAW Digital Programs Vision Statement</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[AWOL is a product of the <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/library">Library
      of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient Word</a>, in close association with the
      <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/about/departments/digital-programs">ISAW Digital Programs
      Department</a>.&nbsp; ISAW Library fully endorses the following vision
      statement.<br /><br /><a
      href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/about/departments/digital-programs">Institute for the Study of the
      Ancient World Digital Programs Vision Statement</a><br /><br /><div
      id="content-core" style="font-family: inherit;"><div class=""
      id="parent-fieldname-text"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><h2> <span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Vision</span></h2><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><i>Unfettered access to ancient world information: any resource, any time,
      anywhere, anyone.</i></span><br /><h2> <span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Mission</span></h2><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><i>Create key information resources for ancient studies, together with the
      platforms and communities that enable them.</i></span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">In order to shape and secure the future of innovative teaching
      and research at ISAW and beyond, we work with others to nurture new and important information
      resources for the ancient world, especially those that connect and contextualize information
      across institutional, methodological, and technological divides. ISAW takes a holistic,
      interdisciplinary approach to ancient studies, eschewing the geographically and linguistically
      bounded modes of scholarly inquiry and communication that have dominated the field.
      Accordingly, <a
      href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/about/departments/digital-programs/digital-programs-staff">the
      Digital Programs team</a> builds infrastructure that bridges gaps in content and function
      while handling the inherent diversity of languages, scripts, geography, chronology,
      methodology, and the like. The resulting tools and data further ISAW’s mission best when we
      create them in collaboration with scholars, students and enthusiasts from both inside and
      outside the Institute and empower them as creators, curators, and users. It is becoming
      increasingly clear that without active and participatory user communities, digital information
      is at risk of decay, loss, and irrelevance. Moreover, quality and sustainability are undercut
      by sequestration behind paywalls, idiosyncratic interfaces, proprietary formats, and rigid
      editorial processes. Therefore, we cultivate empowered communities through partnership,
      openness, usable tools and an embrace of the web with the belief that users will identify,
      invent, contextualize, and promote better resources for the study of antiquity than any single
      project or institutional team.</span><br /><hr /><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">The Digital Programs team has a role in everything from basic
      information technology support and the management of the Institute’s website to a range of
      <a class="internal-link" href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/online-resources">online publication
      projects</a> touching on historical geography, papyrology, epigraphy and more. Under the
      leadership of the <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/people/staff/tom-elliott/">Associate
      Director for Digital Programs</a>, the team works closely with colleagues at ISAW and
      across NYU, as well as with collaborators at a number of other institutions. Digital Programs
      work is funded through a combination of ISAW funds and grants from the <a
      href="http://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a>, the <a
      href="http://mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a> and other
      entities.</span></blockquote></div></div>]]></content>
