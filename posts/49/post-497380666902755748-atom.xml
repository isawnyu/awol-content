   <title type="text">Open Journal Systems Enhancement</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[Many of the <a href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2009/10/alphabetical-list-of-open-access.html">Open Access Journals in Ancient Studies</a> are served from the <span><a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs">Open Journal Systems</a> platform.&nbsp; </span><span>The <a href="http://www.surffoundation.nl/en/Pages/default.aspx">SURFfoundation</a>, has just announced the </span><span>development of two plug-ins permitting the enhancement OJS publications with </span><span>related research data:</span><br /><br /><br /><span></span><a href="http://www.surffoundation.nl/en/actueel/Pages/EnhancedPublicationsnowpossiblewithOpenJournalSystems.aspx">Enhanced Publications now possible with Open Journal Systems</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Research results published within tried-and-tested system using plug-ins</span><br /><div class="print_title">    </div><div class="grey"><span style="font-size: x-small;">       21-02-2012    </span></div><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span>       <br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Internet makes it possible to present publications in combination with related research data, as <a href="http://www.surffoundation.nl/en/themas/openonderzoek/verrijktepublicaties/Pages/default.aspx">Enhanced Publications</a>. <a href="http://www.surffoundation.nl/en/projecten/Pages/EJME.aspx">The Enhanced Journals…Made Easy</a> project (EJME), which is funded by SURF, has designed a practical work  process for publishers of Open Access journals so as to enhance academic  journals with the associated data files. The project involved the  development of two plug-ins for <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs">Open Journal Systems</a>,  a system for managing and publishing journals. Open Journal Systems  (OJS) is the most frequently used open source package worldwide for  academic journals.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Open Journal Systems<br /></strong>OJS is used internationally to promote and increase access to  research results. It is used for more than 10,000 journals. The plug-ins  developed during the EJME project add capabilities to OJS. The <a href="http://www.uva.nl/">University of Amsterdam</a>, <a href="http://www.uu.nl/">Utrecht University</a>, <a href="http://www.dans.knaw.nl/">DANS</a> (Data Archiving and Network Services), and <a href="http://www.aup.nl/">Amsterdam University Press</a> have made use of a tried-and-tested system for creating enhanced  publications so as to stick as close as possible to the publication  process used by researchers.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Publication process<br /></strong>Authors and editors who use OJS can now easily add data files  to articles, including the associated metadata. The data files are then  available – without any extra action being necessary – for everyone  involved in the editorial process, including peer reviewers. When the  article is published, there are references to the datasets, both on the  webpage and in a machine-readable file. It is also important that the  editorial team can make it possible for the data to be automatically  submitted to a reliable data repository when the article is published. </span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">According to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jeroen-sondervan/3/aa2/36a">Jeroen Sondervan</a> (Amsterdam University Press), “This integration of research data and  results on the one hand and publications on the other creates a  completely new way of assessing, verifying, and publishing. The  combination of OJS and the EJME plug-ins brings this a step closer.”</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Practical testing<br /></strong>The EJME plug-ins link up with the work process followed by the  editors of Open Journals: from the researcher’s intention to publish to  the Open Access publication of the article. The plug-ins that have been  developed have been tested in practice by two journals published by two  different publishers:<br />•&nbsp;<a href="http://dpc.uba.uva.nl/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jalc">Journal of Archaeology in the Low Countries</a> (JALC), published by Amsterdam University Press (AUP)<br />•&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/">International Journal of the Commons</a> (IJC), published by UBU/Igitur Publishing.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Public Knowledge Project<br /></strong>Staff of the international OJS are enthusiastic about the EJME  plug-ins and have included them in their plug-in library. “We are very  happy with what EJME has done. The plug-ins are extremely useful and  robust, and the documentation is clear and well written," says <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kevin-stranack/13/521/128">Kevin Stranack</a> of Public Knowledge Project (PKP), the organisation that manages and  develops the OJS. PKP is negotiating with Utrecht University regarding  collaboration to improve the functionality for depositing research data  via OJS.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>More information<br /></strong>For editors of Open Journals: more about <a href="http://wiki.surffoundation.nl/display/vp/Enhanced+Journals+Made+Easy+%28EJME%29">how to present enhanced publications via the available plug-ins</a>. </span></blockquote>]]></content>
