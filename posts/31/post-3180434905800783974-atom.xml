   <title type="text">Deep Imaging Mummy Cases: Non-Destructive Analysis of Multi-Layered Papyrus</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging">Deep Imaging Mummy Cases: Non-Destructive Analysis of Multi-Layered Papyrus</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="org-unit-logo">		<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging">			<img alt="UCL logo" height="200" src="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/images/deepimaging-252b.png" width="163" />&nbsp;</a></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="org-unit-logo"><div class="lead"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Under the direction of University College London (UCL),  this international, multidisciplinary project assesses the feasibility  of using non-destructive digital imaging technology to make texts  visible in images of papyrus in mummy case cartonnages for open research  and analysis.</span></div><div class="lead"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><div class="p"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The massive finding of papyri in Egypt between the end of  the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century has dramatically  increased our knowledge of the ancient world. The recovering of new  texts has brought to light classical and biblical literature, and  everyday writing of people that have changed the way we interpret  antiquity. Papyri were and still are found in two main ways: in situ,  i.e. where they were left by the ancients, or recycled for fabricating  other objects such as mummy masks and coverings, book binding and other  kinds of what scholars broadly define as ‘cartonnage.’ Papyri were also  used sometimes to stuffing animal mummies. In the past, the awareness  that such ancient objects could be filled with manuscripts has led  papyrologists to destroy cartonnage, mummy masks and other material for  retrieving their contents. With the passing of decades, specialists’  recognition of the problems connected with such practice has increased,  and new, less invasive techniques have been developed in order to avoid  the destruction of important historical evidence. The decision to  eventually dismount cartonnage involves careful evaluations of the pros  and cons and of the methods to be followed.</span></div><div class="p"><br /></div><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><div class="p"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Besides papyrologists, conservators and other specialists,  the practice of dissolving cartonnage in order to retrieve papyri has  been employed by dealers and collectors seeing the opportunity to  multiply their earnings or simply looking for manuscripts without  recognizing the issues involved with the destruction of ancient  artefacts. In these cases, the damage produced to our cultural heritage  is even greater since little if any attention to the methods employed  and to the recording of the process is paid.</span></div><div class="p"><br /></div><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><div class="p"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The application of advanced imaging techniques has the  potential to dramatically improve our study of papyri encapsulated in  ancient artefacts and will potentially solve the problem of invasive,  destructive approaches to the remains of our ancient past. This  exploratory, pilot project, working with a range of <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/team-and-partners">international partners</a> and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/collections">collections</a> between November 2015 and May 2016, will test the feasibility of <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/technologies">non-destructive imaging</a> of multi-layered Papyrus found in Egyptian mummy cartonnages. The  project plans to make data freely available, and will publish  lessons-learned on findings and imaging methodologies for further  research.</span></div><nav class="nav nav--left">            <ul><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="navitem selectednav selected-section" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging">Home</a></span>                </li><li>                         			<span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="navitem" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/technologies">Technologies</a></span>                                                     </li><li>                         			<span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="navitem" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/phantoms-and-test-objects">Phantoms and Test Objects</a></span>                                                     </li><li>                         			<span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="navitem" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/collections">The Collections</a></span>                                                     </li><li>                         			<span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="navitem" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/team-and-partners">Project Team and Partner Institutions</a></span>                                                     </li><li>                         			<span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="navitem" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/data">The Data</a></span>                                                     </li><li>                         			<span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="navitem" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/Blog">Blog</a></span>                                                     </li></ul><span style="font-size: x-small;">        </span></nav><span style="font-size: x-small;">&nbsp;</span></div></blockquote>]]></content>
