It intends  to fill a major lacuna in the digital coverage of coin hoards from  antiquity. Its aim is to collect information about hoards of <em>all coinages in use</em> in the Roman Empire between approximately <em>30 BC and AD 400</em>.  Imperial Coinage will form the main focus of the project, but Iron Age  and Roman Provincial coinages issued within this period will also be  included. The data we collect will provide the foundations for a  systematic Empire-wide study of hoarding and will hopefully promote the  integration of numismatic data into broader research on the Roman  Economy.</span><br /><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><em>What is a hoard?</em></strong></span><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">Despite being such a ubiquitous find type throughout the Roman Empire  and beyond, there is no agreed definition of what constitutes a hoard.  In some countries, offerings at temple sites and in graves are  considered to be distinct type of assemblages, whereas in the UK, the  site context is deemed less important than the number of coins deposited  together.</span><br /><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">The Coin Hoards of the Roman Empire Project will employ a very broad definition of hoarding to include <em>any group of coins which appear to have been deliberately deposited together</em>.  We will therefore collect information not only on groups of coins  traditionally identified as 'hoards', but also on funerary deposits and  assemblages classified as 'votive offerings'. Data on single finds of  gold coins will also be incorporated as their high value merits their  consideration as hoards in themselves.</span><br /><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><em>What sort of data are we currently collecting?</em></strong></span><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">The project is currently in its first phase (2013-2017). In this  phase, we aim to collect summary hoard data from as many Roman provinces  as possible, as well as inputting a selection of hoards at the level of  the individual coin. Please be aware that the data available on this  website is constantly being updated and expanded and should not yet be  considered comprehensive.  <em>Until hoards have been marked as validated by a contributor, they will not appear in searches or be visible to public users.</em></span><br /><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><em>Want to learn more?</em></strong></span><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">If you have queries about the project or would like to contribute  digital data or images of hoards, please contact one of the team who  will be happy to help.</span></blockquote></div>]]></content>
