   <title type="text">Describing Egypt</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://describingegypt.com/">Describing Egypt</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="logo" class="hp-logo" id="logo-home" src="http://describingegypt.com/images/logos/alphalogo_3ada.png" /> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">This is an ambitious self initiated project aiming - with a nod and a  wink to the old&nbsp;Description de l'Égypte - to Describe Egypt one location  at a time but this time around we do it through Egyptian Eyes.             We are in love with this country and its long and diverse  history and we want to share our heritage with the whole world through  the latest available technology,             we chose 360º VR immersive experience to be our medium, that  way we allow you to walk through locations that is&nbsp;difficult&nbsp;to access  due to it being closed by authorities             for preservation or due to the fact that you cannot come and  visit it yourself, whatever your reasons are we bring it right to your  screen.             <br /><br />            But we don't want to only show you pretty pictures, we want  to tell you the stories from these locations, stories of their owners  and their life and death, follow the progression of art, culture and  architecture across Egypt's long, rich and diverse history.             <br /><br />            We are currently&nbsp;focusing on the Ancient Egyptian Tombs of  The 30 Dynasties reign which spans across 3000 years (2859 years to be  exact from 3200 BC to 341 BC) we take Examples from the three Major  kingdoms, the Old kingdom [3200 BC - 2780 BC] in Memphis (currently a  suburb of cairo) 3rd to 6th dynasties , the Middle Kingdom [2134 BC -  1778 BC] in Abydos ( currently El Minya) 11th and 12th dynasties and the  New Kingdom [1570 BC - 1080 BC] in&nbsp;Thebes&nbsp;(Luxor) 18th to 20th  dynasties.             <br /><br />            We started working on and off on this project in 2012, it  was originally 360fied.com but due to differences between the partners  visions we have agreed to separate the paths and started all over again.<br />            you can check out the fantastic work of our previous partner and very good friend Mr. Mohamed Attef <a href="http://mohamedattef.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.360cities.net/profile/attef" target="_blank">here</a>. <br />            The Describing Egypt project is currently done in  collaboration between Motion Designer, Compositor and Photographer <a href="https://www.behance.net/SalmaElDardiry" target="_blank">Salma ElDardiry</a> and software Developer and Tech master Karim Mansour.             <br /><br />            We are working with a great set of advisors and collaborators who includes Dr. Thierry Benderitter of <a href="http://www.osirisnet.net/" target="_blank">www.osirisnet.net</a>,  the good poeple of <a href="http://thebanmappingproject.com/" target="_blank">The Theban Mapping Project </a>, <a href="http://www.hanielmasri.com/" target="_blank">Hani D.
