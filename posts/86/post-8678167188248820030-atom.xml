    <title type="text">Soon to be entirely online: Journals of the British School at Athens</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: small;">A few weeks ago Cambridge University
      Press <a
      href="http://journals.cambridge.org/jsp/cjo/common/newslink.jsp?newsid=3408&amp;url=http://journals.cambridge.org/images/fileUpload/images/PBSR_AND_BSA__press_release.pdf">announced</a>
      that the journals of the British Schools at Athens and Rome were joining Cambridge University
      Press.&nbsp; While it is not open access, it is worthy of note since the complete runs of
      these journals are now available online and widely licensed from CUP and JSTOR (see
      below):</span><br /><blockquote><span style="font-size:
      xx-small;">Cambridge University Press has announced that it will become the new home of
      <a
      href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=ATH"><i><b>The
      Annual of the British School at Athens</b></i></a> (BSA) and the <a
      href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=ROM"><i><b>Papers
      of the British School at Rome</b></i></a> (PBSR) from January 2011. This is
      the second consecutive year the Cambridge list has seen expansion and is recognition of the
      Press’s reputation as one of the foremost publishers of classical scholarship in the
      world.</span><br /><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><br
      /><i>The Annual of the British School at Athens</i> publishes accounts of the
      School's projects as well as articles on a wide range of Hellenic subjects spanning a variety
      of disciplines from art to archaeometry and covering Greece throughout history. It is the
      School’s major publication and one of the most important journals in the field. BSA will
      publish its 106th volume with Cambridge in 2011.</span><br /><span
      style="font-size: xx-small;"><br /><i>Papers of the British School at
      Rome</i> is one of the most highly-regarded journals covering the archaeology, history
      and art history of Italy and other parts of the Mediterranean area up to modern times. It is
      edited by senior academics from the British School at Rome’s international pool of affiliated
      scholars, and is the School’s major publication. PBSR will publish its 79th volume with
      Cambridge in 2011.</span> </blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size:
      small;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Both journals will be available in print
      and electronic formats, providing online access to current content for the<br />first
      time. As well as publishing future issues, an online archive of all <i>BSA</i> and
      <i>PBSR</i> volumes will be available as part of the Cambridge Journals Digital
      Archive...</span> </span></blockquote>The collection also, of course,
      includes the Archaeological Reports (AR)<br /><br /><a

      /><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Archaeological
      Reports</i> is published by the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies and the
      British School at Athens, for their subscribers. 'Archaeology in Greece', compiled annually by
      the Director of the British School at Athens, is the only account of recent archaeological work
      in Greece published in English. It is supplemented each year by a regional report on
      archaeology and research from other parts of the ancient Greek and Byzantine world: South
      Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, Albania, Cyprus, Asia Minor and the Black Sea are covered regularly.
      New acquisitions to UK antiquities’ collections and their conservation also
      feature.</span>&nbsp; </blockquote><br /><span style="font-size:
      small;">T</span>he BSA is also working in collaboration with the <span
      style="font-size: 100%;">École française d’Athènes</span> to jointly produce&nbsp;

      in Greece Online / Chronique des fouilles en ligne</a> entirely in electronic
      format.&nbsp; Eventually AR will be incorporated into the online project (and indeed much
      of the online material went into producing the paper AR), and from this year on will be
      up-to-date online, putting in new entries throughout the year as they are produced and
      completed.<br /><br /><br /><a
