   <title type="text">The Nile Delta as a centre of cultural interactions with Upper Egypt and the Southern Levant in 4th millennium BC</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: small;">Open Access Publications of the project “The Nile Delta as a centre of cultural interactions with Upper Egypt and the Southern Levant in 4th millennium BC”</span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.muzarp.poznan.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Nile-Delta-_25mar_2014_mala.pdf"><i>The Nile Delta as a centre of cultural interactions between Upper Egypt and the Southern Levant in 4<sup>th</sup> millennium BC</i></a>, edited by A. Mączyńska, Studies in African Archaeology, vol. 13, Poznań, 2014.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">This volume is part of and concludes the project entitled <i>The Nile Delta as a centre of cultural interactions between Upper Egypt and the Southern Levant in 4<sup>th</sup> millennium BC</i>.  It contains a collection of papers by researchers involved in  investigating the development of the Nile Delta in the Pre- and  Protodynastic Periods. Nearly all of these papers were presented at the  same-titled conference held on June 21 and 22, 2013 in the Archeological  Museum in Poznań, Poland. Although originally planned as a workshop  presenting the results of research carried out as part of the project,  the conference eventually evolved into a major event and became an  opportunity to meet and talk about the role of Delta communities in the  development of the Egyptian civilization in the 4<sup>th</sup>  millennium BC, with particular emphasis on their relations with  neighboring areas, i.e. the Southern Levant and Upper Egypt. The  conference was attended both by project partners and by invited guests  whose papers made an excellent addition to the main topic of the event.  Only the paper by Steven Rosen was presented at a workshop called <i>Imports during the Naqada Period: Investigating Two Sides of a Phenomenon</i> organized by W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in  Jerusalem on November 26, 2012. The main goal of the workshop was to  meet Israeli archeologists, who keep finding Egyptian imports on various  sites. An important element of the workshop was the opportunity to  discuss Egyptian-Levantine relationships not only from the Egyptian, but  also from the Levantine perspective. The article by Steven Rosen is a  fine example here.</span></blockquote><a href="http://www.muzarp.poznan.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AMaczynska_ma%C5%82y-pdf.pdf"><i>Lower Egyptian Communities and Their Interactions with Southern Levant in the 4<sup>th </sup>Millennium BC</i></a>, A. Mączyńska, Studies in African Archaeology, vol. 12, Poznań, 2013.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">This monograph is based on my doctoral dissertation written under the  supervision of professor Lech Krzyżaniak and defended in the fall of  2004. Although many people encouraged me to publish the dissertation and  the Council of the Faculty of History at Adam Mickiewicz University in  Poznań, Poland, issued a positive opinion on the matter, I did not  manage to have my thesis printed. Some of the issues addressed there  were presented at conferences and published as research papers. In May  2011 I received a grant to finance a 3-year project entitled <i>The Nile Delta as a centre of cultural interactions between Upper Egypt and South Levant in 4th millennium B.C</i>.  The grant was part of the Parent Bridge program financed by the  Foundation for Polish Science, was aimed at providing assistance to  young parents-researchers returning to research work after a parenting  break. Publishing my doctoral dissertation was originally one of the  project tasks. However, I well realized that archeological evidence and  its interpretation had changed (sometimes significantly) after 2004.  Likewise, my own views and knowledge had evolved during those years. It  was thus only natural to update the dissertation and to revise my views  presented back in 2004. As a result, this monograph is not merely an  English translation of the dissertation defended nearly 10 years ago,  but also addresses new discoveries from the Nile Delta and Southern  Levant. In addition, it presents my current views on the interactions  between the Delta, Upper Egypt and Canaan, reflecting the last two years  of intensive research.</span></blockquote><div style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.muzarp.poznan.pl/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Tell-el-Farkha-I-Excavations-1998-2011_download.pdf"><i>Tellel-FarkhaI.
