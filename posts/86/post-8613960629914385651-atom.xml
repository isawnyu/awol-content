    <title type="text">News from the Centre for Computer-aided Egyptological Research</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.ccer.nl/">Centre for Computer-aided Egyptological
      Research</a><br /><br />The CCER is circulating <a
      href="http://www.ccer.nl/news.html">this announcement:</a><br
      /><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">Dear colleagues and friends of
      the CCER.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br
      /></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The team of the Centre of
      Computer-aided Egyptological Research (CCER, Utrecht University) has developed pioneering and
      useful computing tools and international projects for Egyptological research since 1990 (among
      other things Manual de Codage, Multilingual Egyptological Thesaurus, Glyph for Windows
      &amp; Extended Library, Coffin Texts Word Index, Egyptian Treasures in Europe, Global
      Egyptian Museum). The CCER was the driving force of the group Informatique &amp;
      Egyptologie and the Horssen Meetings. CCER inspired Egyptological scholars, students and
      institutions to make use of these upcoming new ICT tools and helped them to implement
      them.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br
      /></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Now 20 years after the
      founding of CCER it is time to accept that CCER has become part of history and that the
      well-known CCER site must switch to another life and a new concept. Some years ago it appeared
      that there was no future for CCER in the Netherlands. Besides its director retired. Therefore I
      have decided to stop finally also the shop of the site www.ccer.nl by the end of this year.
      I"ll transmit by then the site and all rights to my former assistant Hans van den Berg. He was
      my gifted and much appreciated "life-ware" and "soft-hand" during many years. He would like to
      use this site to record the history of Computing &amp; Egyptology. He will continue and
      maintain some useful tools for Egyptology on this site as well.</span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Until the end of this year there will be a sale with reduced
      prices of all available products of the former CCER (Glyph for Windows, Hieroglyphica, Coffin
      Texts Word Index etc.).</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br
      /></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Glyph for Windows is a
      16-bit program and will not run with 64-bit (x64) operating systems. Because there will be no
      upgrade of the 16-bit version of Glyph and the extended library, I advise all of you to keep a
      PC with Windows XP, 32-bit Windows Vista or 32-bit Windows 7 to run specially Glyph for Windows
      in order to be able to process your hieroglyphic texts. The last version of Glyph for Windows
      Professional edition (including the extended library) which is compatible with aforementioned
      operating systems can be ordered for only Euro 100 (including
      Hieroglyphica).</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br
      /></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">I would like to thank all
      colleagues, assistants and friends for the collaboration and confidence during those pioneering
      years,</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br
      /></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Dirk van der Plas
