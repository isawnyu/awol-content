      ART RESOURCE, N.Y." width="184" /> ARTstor is sharing a new themed collection of
      approximately 300 images based on the Biblical story of Judith and Holofernes across many
      periods and a wide range of media, including the unprecedented publication of narrative
      sequences in stained glass, relief sculpture and book illustrations. Sponsored by a grant from
      the Jessica E. Smith and Kevin R. Brine Charitable Trust, the collection complements the
      approximately 330 existing images in various other collections in the Digital Library that
      depict figures and events from the Old Testament's <em>Book of Judith</em>.
      According to the <em>Book of Judith</em>, the widow Judith saved the besieged city
      of Bethulia by decapitating the enemy general Holofernes, thereby enabling her Israelite
      countrymen to defeat the invading Assyrians. The powerful appeal to the visual imagination of
      the Judith narrative has inspired and challenged Western scribes, illustrators, draftsman,
      painters, and sculptors for two millennia. Judith was portrayed by both Dante in <em>The
      Divine Comedy</em> and Chaucer in <em>The Canterbury Tales</em>; medieval
      depictions of the narrative cycle may be found in stained glass windows at Sainte-Chapelle in
      Paris and relief sculptures at the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Rouen; Renaissance and baroque
      depictions of Judith abound, including works by artists such as Sandro Botticelli, Michelangelo
      Merisi da Caravaggio, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Donatello, Artemisia Gentileschi, Lorenzo
      Ghiberti, Giorgione, Andrea Mantegna, Michelangelo, Peter Paul Rubens, Titian, and Paolo
      Veronese; and in the 20th century, the theme was treated by Austrian expressionists, French
      surrealists, and contemporary feminist and conceptual artists. </span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Judith and Holofernes collection in ARTstor is
      part of a larger project –<a href="http://workshops.nypl.org/judith" target="_blank"
      title="Go to the Foto Reali Archive page"><em>The Judith Project: Expanding the
      Boundaries of Disciplinarity Through Collaborative Scholarly Practice</em></a>–
      initiated by the Trust to enhance scholarship on The Book of Judith through multidisciplinary
      collaboration and the application of technology. As part of this project, approximately 30
      international scholars were selected by the Trust and an academic panel to participate in the
      <em>Sword of Judith Conference</em> held at the New York Public Library on April
      17-18, 2008 (see K. Brine, E. Ciletti and H. Lëhnemann (editors), <em>The Sword of
      Judith: Judith Studies across the Disciplines</em>, Open Book Publishers, 2010).
      Participants presented their ongoing work for collaboration and exchange at the conference and
      subsequently continued their research in libraries and museums in the United States, Europe,
      and the Middle East. Research has been conducted on Judith as a subject in classical and
      baroque music and dance; the emergence of the theme of Judith in Yiddish literature; the
      resurgent interest in Judith in the 19th and 20th centuries; the relationship of The
      <em>Book of Judith</em> to the Jewish and Christian canons; the Mary/Judith
      typology; and the interpretation of Judith in Jewish, Christian, and secular literature,
      manuscript illuminations, and works of art. ARTstor and the New York Public Library jointly
      created a website and wiki to serve as a bibliographic reference tool and scholarly commons
      that will provide scholars with new avenues for creative multidisciplinary collaboration on the
      Judith theme. Both the wiki and the corpus of images in the ARTstor Digital Library are
      intended to persist beyond the formal conclusion of the project and be available for ongoing
      study and scholarship.&nbsp;</span></blockquote><br /><a
