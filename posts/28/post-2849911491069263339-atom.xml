   <title type="text">Launched: The Humanities Digital Library: Classics from the Institute of Classical Studies</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.humanities-digital-library.org/">The Humanities Digital Library</a> launched <a href="http://talkinghumanities.blogs.sas.ac.uk/2017/01/19/introducing-the-humanities-digital-library/">this week</a>. <br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="Humanities Digital Library" height="114" src="http://www.humanities-digital-library.org/public/presses/1/pageHeaderLogoImage_en_US.png" width="320" />&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">The Humanities Digital Library&nbsp;is the open access library and  catalogue for books published by the School of Advanced Study,  University of London. It forms part of the School’s mission to embrace  the opportunities of digital content delivery and enable greater access  to knowledge. The Humanities Digital Library is managed by the Institute  of Historical Research (IHR) and the Institute of Advanced Legal  Studies (IALS).<br /><br /> We publish new titles, through our <a href="http://humanities-digital-library.sas.ac.uk/index.php/hdl/openaccess" target="_blank">open access programmes</a>,  as well as open access versions of books previously available only in  print. Each book is available as an open access PDF (full text) but can  also be purchased in print (hardback and paperback) or as an ebook (EPUB  format). Scholarly content made available through the website includes  monographs, edited collections and shorter form works.<br /><br /> With open access providing increased accessibility and visibility to  scholarly research, and becoming ever more relevant to research and  funding councils, the Humanities Digital Library aims to bring together  and promote freely available research for the School, its constituent  Institutes and the wider humanities community.<br /><br /> In the first of our publishing partnerships, the Institute of  Historical Research is working alongside&nbsp;the Royal Historical Society to  bring their new open access series, <em>New Historical Perspectives</em> to the Humanities Digital Library. We expect the first books to be published in 2017-18. Learn&nbsp;more about our&nbsp;<a href="http://humanities-digital-library.sas.ac.uk/index.php/hdl/publishing">Partnerships</a>.<br /><br /> The Open Access project team behind the Humanities Digital Library  are: Jane Winters, Chair in Digital Humanities at the School of Advanced  Study; Steve Whittle,&nbsp;Information Systems Manager at the Institute of  Advanced Legal Studies; Philip Carter, Head of Digital at the Institute  of Historical Research; and Jon Newbury, Publishing Manager at  the&nbsp;Institute of Historical Research. </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">The website is managed by Jon Newbury, Publishing Manager,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jonathan.newbury@sas.ac.uk">jonathan.newbury@sas.ac.uk</a>.</blockquote>Among the initial set of subjects is <a href="http://www.humanities-digital-library.org/index.php/hdl/catalog/category/classics">Classics</a> from the <a href="http://www.humanities-digital-library.org/index.php/hdl/catalog/category/ics">Institute of Classical Studies</a> is the following volume listed as forthcoming in early 2017"<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><a class="title" href="http://www.humanities-digital-library.org/index.php/hdl/catalog/book/9">Profession and Performance: Aspects of oratory in the Greco-Roman World 			</a>			<br /><div class="author">				Editors: Christos Kremmydas, Jonathan Powell, Lene Rubinstein 			</div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="value">					<span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>*THIS FORTHCOMING EBOOK WILL BE AVAILABLE IN EARLY 2017*</strong> </span></div></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="value"><span style="font-size: x-small;">This volume brings together six papers relating to oratory and orators in public <em>fora</em> of Classical Greece and Rome. Edwards and Bers explore aspects of  oratorical delivery in the Athenian courts and Assembly, including the  demands placed on orators by the physical settings. Tempest examines the  conceptions of oratorical competence and incompetence, particularly in  respect of performance, as they are implied in Cicero’s criticisms of  the rival prosecutor in the trial of Verres. Papers by Karambelas and  Powell look at evidence for the importance of advocacy in the Second  Sophistic and the late Roman Empire respectively. In an introduction,  the editors discuss recurrent themes connected with the orator’s  competence and performance, while the final paper of the volume, by Lord  Justice Laws, reflects on the continuing relevance of rhetoric in the  modern, highly professionalised practice of the law in England.</span><br /> 				</div></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"></blockquote>]]></content>
