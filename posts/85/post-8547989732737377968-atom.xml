   <title type="text">Papyrological Navigatior Updates</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[Posted today on <a href="http://lists.hum.ku.dk/pipermail/papy/2011-December/000702.html">papy</a>, and on<a href="http://digitalpapyrology.blogspot.com/http://digitalpapyrology.blogspot.com/2011/12/papyriinfo-updates.html"> Digital Papyrology:</a> <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><pre><span style="font-size: x-small;">Colleagues:<br /><br />I write with some IDP updates.<br /><br />(1) By now you will have noticed that we have rolled out the new search <br />interface. This is an entirely new way of doing search and will take <br />some getting used to.<br /><br />A crude test scenario:<br /><br />Go to <a href="http://papyri.info/search">http://papyri.info/search</a> . The search screen is divided into two <br />parts. Search results appear on the right and search filters appear on <br />the left.<br /><br />The primary difference between the old and the new is that rather than <br />coming up with a single search query that aims to give you exactly what <br />you want, it is now possible to begin with a more open-ended search and <br />successively narrow and expand it until you reach a desired end.<br /><br />So, let's say your class is interested in literacy. Run an initial <br />search for #αγραμματ: enter #αγραμματ in the search box or select <br />"Convert from betacode as you type" and enter #agrammat (by the way, <br />this is a good option if you want to run searches from your smartphone, <br />which probably does not have Unicode Greek); click 'Search'. This will <br />give you words beginning with αγραμματ (# indicates a boundary; you will <br />not find διαγρραμματ)<br /><br />You get 446 hits--too many to show your class. You select (toward the <br />bottom) "Show only records with images from:" / "Papyri.info" and click <br />'Go'. This will narrow your found set down to the 16 texts that contain <br />a word beginning with αγραμματ and are known (via APIS) to Papyri.info. <br />But there must be more: HGV knows about a great many links to other <br />sites (external to papyri.info). So, you select "Other sites" and 'Go'. <br />Now you have 221 records for which some digital image is known, whether <br />via APIS or HGV. Add "Print publications" and you will see that <br />papyri.info knows of a total of 337 texts that have *some* image <br />associated with them, whether digital or print.<br /><br />Your class is working on texts from the first 2 centuries CE. So, you <br />set "Date on or after" at "1 CE" and "Date on or before" to "200 CE" and <br />click Go. That's 45 hits. The classroom where you are teaching has <br />digital projection, but no access to books. So, you *remove* the "Print <br />images exist" filter by clicking it away from the top of the right side <br />of your screen. That's 28 hits; you can actually look at several of <br />these in class.<br /><br />A student asks how many of these were written on behalf of a man or a <br />woman. Well, it wouldn't be a foolproof test, but you can now add <br />another Greek search as an additional filter. So, enter "υπερ αυτης" (as <br />"Word/Phrase search", which assumes that the strings that you enter are <br />complete words) or "υπερ# #αυτης" (as "Substring search", which assumes <br />that the strings you enter are fragments, unless you indicate a boundary <br />with #). Now we have 9 hits.<br /><br />Not all of the students in the class have strong Greek; so, you also set <br />"Translation language" to "English" and you are down to 3 hits. Note: <br />these filters are defined by what is in the system, so that if 5 of <br />these texts had been translated into, say, Italian, you would have found <br />that as one of your filter options. At the moment, most of the <br />translations known to papyri.info come from APIS and so are in English.<br /><br />You may remove any of these filters by deselecting them (click the X <br />next to each at the top of the window). Remember to remove all such <br />queries before starting a completely *new* search (or click on the <br />“Reset all” button.)<br /><br />This is a somewhat silly example, but it should give you the basic idea <br />of how this new approach works and how it differs from the old. It takes <br />some getting used to, but once all of the functionality is in place you <br />will find that it is a much more powerful and flexible manner of searching.<br /><br />Also, if you would like to track our progress toward implementing more <br />complicated search functionality, you may feel free to look at the <br />following Google Doc:<br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ajkz6D9lOd20dGtwczJSUXVhWUx6ZEJCUEhvR1lIYVE&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ajkz6D9lOd20dGtwczJSUXVhWUx6ZEJCUEhvR1lIYVE&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0</a><br />It is meant for our own internal use and so may not make perfect sense <br />to you, but you should probably get the idea. Y = we expect this to work <br />now. N = we expect this not to work now. dev = our test / development <br />server. prodo = the production version of papyri.info, which you use. If <br />your favorite search pattern is not there, and if you cannot achieve the <br />same result with a combination of filters, we encourage you, please, to <br />*send us an email*. If you don’t report an error or omission, there is a <br />good chance we won’t know to correct it!<br /><br />(2) You will have noted also that tens of thousands of ‘original’ <br />readings now have diacriticals. So, where the scribe wrote αναδεχομε, we <br />put the normalized “ἀναδέχομαι” in the text and now print “ἀναδέχομε <br />papyrus” in the apparatus. Before the year is out we shall invert this <br />practice, printing “ἀναδέχομε” in the text and “read ἀναδέχομαι” in the <br />apparatus. This first step has been a bigger task than we had imagined, <br />and we owe a great deal to the brilliant and devoted work of Faith <br />Lawrence at the Department of Digital Humanities, King’s College London. <br />A few thousand words still lack accents; please feel free to add such <br />and submit them to us. Some small number or errors have been introduced <br />along the way (outright mistakes, which will be clearly apparent as <br />nonsense); we are hacking away at those, fixing as many of them as we <br />can; but if you notice any please feel free to correct and submit, or <br />else (if is seems to be a systematic kind of error) please just alert us <br />by email.<br /><br />(3) Note also that the process of adding accents and reversing the <br />display-regime of regularizations was more difficult in the case of <br />regularized words that wrapped from the end of one line to the beginning <br />of the next. Many thousands of these we handled automatically; about <br />6000 or so still need to be fixed. We think we are in position to have <br />80-90% fixed in the next couple weeks. In the meantime, all lines <br />affected by this are flagged with a bright red line number--you may have <br />noticed this already. In all such lines you will see that chunks of <br />words appear oddly at the end or beginning of an affected line; the <br />apparatus entries for all such will look fine.<br /><br />(4) The line-by-line commentary feature has a bug, which will create a <br />dozen or so clones of some commentary entries...this is very <br />frustrating. It should be fixed before the new year. Just don’t enter <br />any commentary in the next few weeks!<br /><br />(5) Frequent Papyrological Editor users will notice that we have <br />radically overhauled our apparatus criticus capabilities.<br /><br />* for BL corrections: &lt;:αἱ τοῦ=BL 9.17|ed|Θίτου:&gt;<br />* for corrections proposed in journals/books: &lt;:(διαγρ(άφου))=N.

[ca.?]" or "γ . . . [ca.?]", and which is <br />recorded in BL vol.19 p.2<br /><br />(ii) previously, Cowey had argued (in ZPE 200) for correcting the text <br />to either στρ[ατηλάτης], which is a modern regularization of <br />ξ̣τ̣ρ[ατηλάτης], or to ". γρ[ca.?]"<br /><br />(iii) before Cowey, Ast had suggested (in CdÉ 100) that the papyrus <br />reads στυ̣ρ[ατ- ca.?], which should be regularized either to στρ[ατιώτης] <br />or to στρ[ατηγία]; this was subsequently picked up by BL 14.5<br /><br />(iv) The original editors of the papyrus thought that the scribe had <br />originally written "Σ . . ρ[ίων]", and then corrected it to either <br />Σο̣υ̣ρ[ίων] or Συ̣υ̣ρ[ίων] or Σω̣υ̣ρ[ίων], any one of which should perhaps be <br />regularized to Συρ[ίων]<br /><br />The PN will display στρ[ατηγὸς] in the text and in the app: 275. corr. <br />ex σ ̣ ̣[ -ca.?- ] (or γ ̣ ̣ ̣[ -ca.?- ]) BL 19.2 : ξ̣τ̣ρ[ατηλάτης] (l. <br />στρ[ατηλάτης]) (or ̣γρ[ -ca.?- ]) J. Cowey, ZPE 200 (2020) 321-323 : <br />στυ̣ρ[ατ -ca.?- ] (l. στρ[ατιώτης (or στρ[ατηγία])) R. Ast, CdE 100 <br />(2018) 13-15 (BL 14.5) : Σο̣υ̣ρ[ίων] (or Συ̣υ̣ρ[ίων] or Σω̣υ̣ρ[ίων]) (corr. ex <br />Σ ̣ ̣ρ[ίων]) (l. Συρ[ίων]) Original Edition. This is not *precisely* what <br />you expect to find in a print publication, but it is full, clear, and <br />quite unambiguous.<br /><br />This is, we think, a huge achievement and a great good; we have Gabby <br />Bodard at King’s College and Jon Fox at the University of Kentucky to thank!<br /><br />The Leiden+ Documentation page should now reflect most/all of these <br />improvements: (<a href="http://papyri.info/editor/documentation?docotype=text">http://papyri.info/editor/documentation?docotype=text</a>); <br />please let us know if we have missed something. Also, please note that <br />the Apparatus “Helpers” (for BL, Editorial, and SoSOL) are now buggy as <br />a result of the changes but should be fixed before the new year. In the <br />meantime, enter apparatus entries by hand.<br /><br />(6) I shall also mention just briefly that thanks to the extraordinary <br />generosity and collegiality of our colleagues in Brussels, Alain Martin, <br />Paul Heilporn, and Alain Delattre, we have begun a process of surfacing <br />Bibliographie Papyrologique data via the PN. Our Heidelberg colleagues <br />James Cowey and Carmen Lanz did an amazing amount of work to make this <br />happen. You will see that there are still many bugs in the conversion of <br />the BP records to structured XML, but we are getting there one step at a <br />time. From the navigation bar at the top of the PN select Search / <br />Bibliography. This will take you to a very *simple* search screen, where <br />you may enter, for example, “Hombert” (no quotation marks) <br />(<a href="http://papyri.info/bibliosearch?q=Hombert">http://papyri.info/bibliosearch?q=Hombert</a>); or you may constrain the <br />search by BP fields. So, if you enter “author:Hombert; <br />title:bibliographie; date:1932” (no quotation marks) you will get 2 <br />records <br />(<a href="http://papyri.info/bibliosearch?q=author%3AHombert%3B+title%3Abibliographie%3B+date%3A1932+">http://papyri.info/bibliosearch?q=author%3AHombert%3B+title%3Abibliographie%3B+date%3A1932+</a>). <br />This works also for BP subject codes; so, for example, “index:146” will <br />find 1106 records concerning Archives. The FileMaker version of the BP <br />remains much more flexible, powerful, and manipulable, for those users <br />who are so inclined. In the next few weeks we shall be able to link from <br />BP records to DDbDP texts and from DDbDP texts to BP records. This is <br />only a start; we expect this service to improve dramatically over the <br />coming months, soon with the ability to add/correct records, and submit <br />them for review by the BP editorial team.<br /><br />This message is already far too long. So, enough for now.<br /><br />As always, please feel free to send questions, comments, complaints to <br />Josh Sosin &lt;<a href="http://lists.hum.ku.dk/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/papy">jds15 at duke.edu</a>&gt;, Rodney Ast &lt;<a href="http://lists.hum.ku.dk/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/papy">ast at uni-heidelberg.de</a>&gt;, and <br />James Cowey &lt;<a href="http://lists.hum.ku.dk/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/papy">james.cowey at urz.uni-heidelberg.de</a>&gt;; same, with regard to PN <br />performance to Hugh Cayless &lt;<a href="http://lists.hum.ku.dk/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/papy">hugh.cayless at nyu.edu</a>&gt;.<br /><br />All best,<br />Rodney Ast<br />James Cowey<br />Josh Sosin<br /></span></pre></blockquote>]]></content>
