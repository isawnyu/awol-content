    <title type="text">Last House on the Hill: A New hybrid publication from the Cotsen
      Institute</title>

      style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">New hybrid publication
      from the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology Press,</span></div><div
      class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">available at the AAA meetings this Fall: <a
      href="http://lasthouseonthehill.org/"><i>Last House on the
      Hill</i></a></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:
      justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:
      justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><i><span style="background: none
      repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">Last House on the Hill</span></i><span
      style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;"> is a digital multigraph mirror of the
      <a href="http://unmpress.com/books.php?ID=20000000005615&amp;Page=book">printed
      monograph</a> of the same name. The book and digital component comprise the final report
      of the Berkeley Archaeologists at Çatalhöyük (BACH) project, in which a team from the
      University of California at Berkeley excavated a group of Neolithic 9000-year old buildings at
      this famous cultural heritage location in Central Anatolia, Turkey. </span><span
      style="color: #272627;">By creating an on-line media- and data-rich edition of <i>Last
      House on the Hill</i>, we hope to keep alive, and open for critique and further
      elaboration, the narratives about the archaeology, history, cultural heritage, and memories of
      the BACH project. &nbsp;The digital edition of <i>Last House on the Hill</i> is
      available as a “Cloud”-based database running on your desktop and as an iPad application, which
      brings together digital versions of the printed texts and authors’ supplemental materials along
      with the full archaeological record. The ambition of the digital edition of <i>Last House
      on the Hill</i> is to embed, interweave, entangle, and otherwise link the complete
      project database (including all media formats such as photographs, videos, maps, line drawings
      as well as data analysis and interpretation) with the final synthetic contents held in the
      printed edition in an open access, sharable platform. It is an open-ended data stream that can
      grow and—as long as it is well curated—can live for many decades. Rather than building a
      repository of content </span>that merely replicates in digital the fragmented nature of
      miscellaneous archives<span style="color: #272627;">, we have worked to ensure that the
      on-line edition provides a sustainable and extensible framework through which researchers,
      visitors, and future scholars can all make substantive contributions and that it will serve as
      an engaging model for the digital publication of archaeological
      content.</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br
      /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #272627;">An essential information
      management challenge for a project of this magnitude is how to make sense of such an enormity
      of information and rich media. &nbsp;</span>Through the metaphor of a strongly
      visual, web-like navigation through content, we provide an interface to meaningful relations
      existing amongst the records and different media collections that would otherwise remain
      unexplored, such as who or what is represented in a photography, drawing, or mentioned in a
      document.<span style="color: #272627;"> We believe that the mass of archaeological
      documentation gains its full significance for a study of the past if it is represented as the
      relationships among people, places and things, their representation through media, and the
      contingencies of time and space, all of which contribute to the creation of the archaeological
      record. Thus, the ultimate aim of the digital edition of <i>Last House on the Hill
      </i>is to have both archaeologists and a broader public be inspired to</span> track
      back from the “official” interpretation to the original<span style="color:
      #9900ff;"></span><span style="color: #272627;">data and media in order to
      download, recontextualize and remix them in creative and productive ways. </span>In the
      age of mobile computing, iPads, and Android devices, there is an ever-increasing market
      pressure to provide easy-to-use and powerful tools for self-expression (publishing), coupled
      with robust digital asset management and archiving through “cloud” computing. We are optimistic
      that these market changes will continue to positively influence traditional archives and
      publishers to reconsider what it means to be “done” with an archaeological publication.
