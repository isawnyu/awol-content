   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GrandLatMisc/hawara/index.html">P.Hawara</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GrandLatMisc/hawara/papimages/images/phaw_041_r.jpg" class="decoded" height="200" src="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GrandLatMisc/hawara/papimages/images/phaw_041_r.jpg" width="197" /></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><h1 class="content"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Hawara Papyri</span></h1><span style="font-size: x-small;">                                                         </span><div class="content"><span style="font-size: x-small;">William Flinders Petrie excavated at Hawara in  1888. After working in Medinet el-Fayum (Arsinoe) and Biahmu, he moved  on to the site south of Arsinoe and took the 60 workers he had already  employed at the former sites with him. The results of his excavations at  Hawara were published in 1889 in his "Hawara, Biahmu, and Arsinoe". The  papyrological material said to have been found at Hawara was studied by  Prof. Sayce and published on pages 24 to 37 of that volume. Sayce gave a  general description of the great papyrus roll which contains parts of  books 1 and 2 of the Iliad (the "Hawara Homer"), emphasizing the  importance of the variants, and edited the texts of the most complete  documents, some of them in a very preliminary way.</span></div><div class="content"><br /></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">      </span><div class="content"><span style="font-size: x-small;">J. G. Milne undertook a new edition of 37 of these papyri in the <em>Archiv f√ºr Papyrusforschung</em> 5, 1913, 378-397. He did not work on the Hawara Homer but concentrated  on the smaller literary texts and gave a proper publication of some more  documents. The texts which were not reconsidered in Milne's publication  were reprinted in <em>Sammelbuch</em> I (nos. 5220, 5223, 5224).</span></div><div class="content"><br /></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">      </span><div class="content"><span style="font-size: x-small;">When Flinders Petrie brought his finds back to  England, the material was divided between several institutions. The  Hawara Homer was given to the Bodleian Library in Oxford (where it   still is today), while all the other papyrological material stayed in  London and was given to the Department of Egyptology at University  College London. In 1948, the young professor of Papyrology, Eric Turner  received permission from the then Professor of Egyptology, J. Czerny, to  take the Hawara papyri to the Department of Greek and Latin at UCL and  to keep them there in his custody. A letter from 16 June 1949 confirms  the transfer of the papyri. They were kept in a secret place in the  department for more than 50 years.</span></div><div class="content"><br /></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">      </span><div class="content"><span style="font-size: x-small;">As usual, Flinders Petrie did not give precise  indications, as to where the papyri were found on the site. He just  mentions that the region north of the pyramid "was the usual place for  burials in the early Roman period , when gilt cartonnage busts were  used. Papyri from the Ist and IInd cent. AD are also usual in the soil  here, and for some way north" (p. 8, no. 11; cf. the map on plate XXV in  the book).</span></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">      </span><div class="content"><span style="font-size: x-small;">When the papyri arrived in London they were  "ironed" by Petrie's friend, Mr. Spurrell who also helped in "unpacking,  arranging, and managing the collections" (p. 4). It must have happened  then that all the pieces were glued onto greyish cardboard. When writing  was distiguishable on the back of the papyri, windows were cut out to  make the letters (at least in part) visible. In some instances, Petrie  added small notes in pencil about find-spots. In later years, Walter  Cockle removed some of the papyri from their cardboards and put them  under glass. The cardboard frames of these pieces were nevertheless  kept.</span></div><div class="content"><br /></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">      </span><div class="content"><span style="font-size: x-small;">It is a desideratum to make digital images of  at least the published papyri accessible on the internet. None of the  Hawara papyri (except for single columns of the Hawara Homer, Hawara  epigrams, and the Periegesis of Attica), have ever been shown in  photographs.</span></div><div class="content"><br /></div><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="nav"><tbody><tr><td class="navlevel01"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GrandLatMisc/hawara/index.html">Home</a></span></td>                              <td><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></td>                           </tr><tr>                              <td><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></td>                              <td class="navlevel01"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GrandLatMisc/hawara/idcs/idcs.html">Indices</a></span></td>                              <td><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></td>                           </tr><tr>                              <td><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></td>                              <td class="navlevel02"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GrandLatMisc/hawara/idcs/idx_sbnumber.html">by SB no.</a></span></td>                              <td><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></td>                           </tr><tr>                              <td><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></td>                              <td class="navlevel02"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GrandLatMisc/hawara/idcs/idx_number.html">by PHaw. inv. no.</a></span></td>                              <td><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></td>                           </tr><tr>                           </tr><tr>                              <td><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></td>                              <td class="navlevel02"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GrandLatMisc/hawara/idcs/idx_date.html">by date</a></span></td>                              <td><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></td>                           </tr><tr>                              <td><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></td>                              <td class="navlevel02"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GrandLatMisc/hawara/idcs/idx_content.html">by content</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="content"><br /></div></blockquote>]]></content>
