   <title type="text">Online Guide to Evagrius Ponticus</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: xx-small;">[First posted in AWOL 17 January 2012, updated 9 February 2016] </span><br /><br /><a href="http://evagriusponticus.net/">Guide to Evagrius Ponticus</a><br />edited by Joel Kalvesmaki<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://evagriusponticus.net/images/EvPontP923-290r-bw.gif" src="http://evagriusponticus.net/images/EvPontP923-290r-bw.gif" height="200" width="193" /></blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Evagrius Ponticus (b. 345 in Ibora; d. 399 in Egypt), a monastic theologian, was one     of the most talented intellects of the fourth century. Circulating in elite     ecclesiastical circles of Cappadocia and Asia Minor, he began his career under Basil     of Caesarea and Gregory of Nazianzus, serving with the latter in Constantinople     through a stormy tenure that culminated in the Second Ecumenical Council (381).     Known then as a brilliant heresiologist, Evagrius seemed destined for a successful     ecclesiastical career. He chose a different course, and fled to Jerusalem, where he     took vows in the monastic communities of Rufinus and Melania. From there he     traveled to Egypt and lived in monasteries in Nitria and Kellia. In Egypt he wrote     extensively in a variety of genres—letters, proverbs, brief sayings     (chapters), and treatises—nearly all geared toward explaining and analyzing     vice and virtue, demons and angels, psychological and psychosomatic     phenomena—in sum, the life of the ascetic. His accounts are set, sometimes     explicitly, oftentimes pensively, within a well-developed metaphysical system that     responded to both classical philosophy (Plato, Aristotle, Stoicism) and the theology     of some of the most accomplished Christian intellectuals (Clement of Alexandria,     Origen, Gregory of Nazianzus). </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Although well connected in his own time, Evagrius fell into disrepute in the sixth     century, when his writings, along with those of Origen and Didymus the Blind, were     associated with a theological strain of Origenism condemned at the Fifth Ecumenical     Council (553). The more speculative of Evagrius's writings fell out of circulation     in the Byzantine Greek manuscript tradition. Those works survive in a number of     other languages, principally Syriac, Armenian, Georgian, and     Arabic—linguistic traditions whose reception of Origen and Evagrius were not     as controversial. His writings deeply influenced many theologians and monastic     writers, including Sts. John Cassian, "Dionysius the Areopagite," Maximus Confessor,     John Climacus, Isaac of Nineveh, and Simeon the New Theologian. The Armenian     Orthodox Church commemorates him, as did some Syriac-speaking Orthodox churches, but     his condemnation is maintained by the Eastern Orthodox Church and, with important     caveats (e.g., his recent inclusion in <i>Butler's Lives of the Saints</i>), the     Roman Catholic Church.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">This <i>Guide</i> provides definitive lists of Evagrius's works, of editions and     translations of those works, and of studies related to his life and thought. It     includes an inventory of key ancient sources that refer to Evagrius and a display of     imagery from the ancient world. Updated quarterly, the <i>Guide</i> will gradually     introduce a manuscript checklist, images of manuscripts, transcriptions of those     manuscripts, and open source critical editions of Evagrius's writings. </span></blockquote><div class="nav"><blockquote><ul class="banner"></ul><div class="nav"><ul class="banner"><li><a class="banner" href="http://evagriusponticus.net/index.htm">Introduction</a></li><li><a class="banner" href="http://evagriusponticus.net/life.htm">Life</a></li><li><a class="banner" href="http://evagriusponticus.net/corpus.htm">Writings</a></li><li><a class="banner" href="http://evagriusponticus.net/images.htm">Images</a></li><li><a class="banner" href="http://evagriusponticus.net/bibliography.htm">Bibliography</a></li><li><a class="banner" href="http://evagriusponticus.net/about.htm">Credits</a></li></ul></div><ul class="banner"></ul></blockquote></div><a class="banner" href="http://evagriusponticus.net/about.htm"></a><br /><div class="nav"></div>]]></content>
