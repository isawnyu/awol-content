   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: xx-small;">[First posted in AWOL 1 June 2010. Updated 28 March 2016] </span><br /><br /><a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/Practitioners/index.htm">Practitioners' Voices in Classical Reception Studies</a><br />ISSN: 1756-5049<br /><div align="justify"><span style="font-size: 85%;"><i></i></span></div><blockquote><div align="justify"><span style="font-size: 85%;"><i>PVCRS </i>is  very much a companion publication  to our ejournal <i><a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/newvoices/index.htm">New  Voices in Classical Reception Studies</a> </i> and our <a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/e_archive/about.htm">Eseminar  Archive</a>. All add to the range of resources that are made freely  available on the Open University Reception of Classical Texts Research  Project website. <i>New Voices </i> provides a refereed platform for  newer researchers to publish their work. The Eseminar Archive makes  available the records of the annual seminar that discusses all aspects  of classical reception. <i>Practitioners' Voices </i> is a response to  the growing awareness that Classical Reception research has to  recognise the full range of processes that shape the impact of classical  material in new contexts. Its aim is to provide a Forum in which  theatre directors, designers, dramaturgs, actors, poets, translators,  and all involved in the creative  practices that are so crucial to  classical receptions can discuss the relationship between their work and  the classical texts, themes and contexts on which they draw. </span></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-size: 85%;">We hope that the Forum will also lead  to further dialogue between creative practitioners and critics and  academics (who are after all also practitioners). </span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="clearfix" id="tabs-wrapper">                                        <h1 class="with-tabs"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Current Issue</span></h1><span style="font-size: x-small;">                              </span></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">                                                                  </span><div class="content clearfix"><span style="font-size: x-small;">    </span><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The following&nbsp;articles from the 2015 issue are&nbsp;now available:</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><div class="ou-grid 401"><div class="ou-feature-block ou-light-blue ou-feature-block-link"><h2><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/arts/research/pvcrs/2015/icke" target="_self">Robert Icke</a></span></h2><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Robert Icke</strong> is an award-winning writer and theatre director, who became Associate  Director at the Almeida Theatre in London in 2013.
