It is the mythical setting for the final episodes of Virgil's  epic poem <em>Aeneid</em>, the story of Aeneas, where the Trojan hero  and his companions, on their way to found a new Troy, first set foot in  Italy and are received by Latinus, king of the Laurentes, in a grand  palace in the woods.  Aeneas marries Latinus' daughter Lavinia, together  they found the new city of Lavinium, and their descendants go on to  become the kings of Alba Longa and thence of Rome. Rome's first emperor  Augustus, for whom Virgil's poem was written, possessed a Laurentine  estate (called <em>Laurentum</em>) probably centred on a huge maritime  villa at Tor Paterno, which continued to be enlarged and embellished by  successive emperors, especially under the Antonines of the later 2nd  century AD. The city of Lavinium, which had declined in the 2nd century  BC, was revived under Augustus' patronage, as the centre of an important  imperial priesthood, the Lauro-Lavinates.  The Laurentine forests  became imperial game parks, where elephant and camel herds were based  under the care of special procurators, where the emperors' game keepers  trained exotic imported wild animals for the hunt and for the arena.   New populations of Laurentes, formed of army veterans, were settled in  the territory of Lavinium, in the ager Laurens and around the Ostian  lake.  The sea front - the Laurentine Shore - was developed into a  monumental 'maritime fa√ßade' to rival that at Alexandria, lined with the  luxury villas of the imperial family and its elite circle, among them  that of Pliny the Younger, described by him at length and exceptional  detail in a letter of about AD100.&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="credits"></span>&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><ul class="dlMenu"><li>  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/castelporziano_ahrc_2010/index.cfm">Introduction</a></span> </li><li>  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/castelporziano_ahrc_2010/overview.cfm">Overview</a></span> </li><li>     <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/castelporziano_ahrc_2010/downloads.cfm">Downloads</a></span>  </li><li>   <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/castelporziano_ahrc_2010/metadata.cfm">Metadata</a></span>  </li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">   <a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/castelporziano_ahrc_2010/stats.cfm">Usage Statistics</a></span>  </li></ul></blockquote>]]></content>
