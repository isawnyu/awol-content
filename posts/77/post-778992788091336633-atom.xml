      Excavations of the Late Roman and Early Byzantine Sites in the Kharga Oasis collection
      comprises administrative paperwork; concession papers; correspondence; field notes; glass plate
      negatives; large-scale architectural drawings, site plans, and tracings; photographs (attached
      to boards and loose); and sketches documenting the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s excavations of
      late Roman and early Byzantine sites (primarily the <a

      and later construction at the Temple of Amun at <a
      href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/776181">Hibis</a>) in the northern district of
      the Kharga Oasis.</span></span><br /> <br /> <span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><span>In 1907, the Antiquities Service of the Egyptian Government granted
      the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Egyptian Expedition a concession to survey and excavate in the
      northern district of the Kharga Oasis, located about 400 miles southwest of Cairo and 120 miles
      west of Thebes. The Kharga concession included multiple sites of interest —the well-known Hibis
      and Nadura temples and the Bagawat necropolis as well as numerous Roman and Early Byzantine
      structures. It was this concentration of sites dating to the later periods of Egyptian history
      that attracted the MMA. Writing in the <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3253348"
      target="_blank">May 1908 <em>Bulletin</em> (vol. 3, no. 5)</a>, Albert M.
      Lythgoe (1868–1934), the MMA’s first curator of Egyptian art and director of the Egyptian
      Expedition, stated that the concession was sought "in order to take advantage of the favorable
      conditions…for the investigation of the remains of the later period—Greco-Roman and Early
      Christian" (p. 84).</span></span><br /> <br /> <span

      1908–1931</strong>&nbsp;</span></span><br /> <span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><span>The "Correspondence" series contains original
      correspondence and photocopies of original material generated by the Museum’s Egyptian
      Expedition, including exchanges between the Expedition members and Egyptian Department staff,
      Museum administrators, Service des Antiquités officials, and other Egyptologists. The letters
      detail work being conducted at the site, as well as discussions of the concession, publishing
      rights, and other administrative issues. <a

      Excavation Records and Research 1907-1937, 1982-1989
      </strong></span></span><br /> <span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><span>The "Excavation Records and Research" series includes original
      administrative paperwork, field notes, unpublished manuscripts, research, and sketches and
      photocopies of original concessions issued by the Service des Antiquités, H. E. Winlock’s
      excavation journal and his history of the Egyptian Expedition, material relating to A. Hrdlicka
      and the National Museum of Natural History, and shipment lists. Of particular interest are the
      tomb cards that record information about mummies found in pit graves and tomb chapels and, in
      some cases, list grave goods. Most of the material in Series II was created by Expedition
      members. H. E. Winlock, A. M. Jones, and H. G. Evelyn-White conducted the early fieldwork
      (prior to World War I), and following World War I, W. Hauser, C. K. Wilkinson, and N. G. Davies
      worked at Kharga. Wherever possible the author of the material is indicated.&nbsp;<a
