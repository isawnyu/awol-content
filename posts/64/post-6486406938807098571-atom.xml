    <title type="text">The Mahmoud Salih Collection</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://digitalt.uib.no/handle/1956/1">The Mahmoud Salih
      Collection</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><b>As a journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step, so a
      collection of books must begin with a single book.</b></span>
      </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Early in March 1997, Lady Elizabeth Bingham, a very dear friend
      and colleague at SOS Sahel UK (a charity that helps the people of the Sahel to fight poverty
      through better management of their environment) was passing through Cairo from Sudan where she
      was inspecting some of SOS Sahel’s projects. I happened to mention to her that I have been
      searching for a book for the last ten years without success. The book was “Capital Investment
      in Africa – Its Course And Effects”, by S Herbert Frankel, Professor of Economics and Economic
      History at University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. The book was published by Oxford
      University Press in 1938. Sir Hubert Huddleston, Governor-General of the Sudan (1940-47) had
      quoted a passage from it in his 1941 annual report. The quotation was:</span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><br
      /><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">“There can be doubt that the
      economic development of the Sudan in the twentieth century has been a remarkable achievement
      and one which, in many respects, can be regarded as a model for other African
      Countries”.</span></blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">
      </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">That quotation intrigued me, and I wanted
      to read everything he had written about Sudan in that book.</span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Within days
      of Lady Elizabeth’s departure from Cairo to London, I received a copy in the post of the book.
      In her accompanying letter she informed me that her book seller had put her in touch with a
      certain Paul Wilson, an antiquarian book dealer who specialised in African and Middle-Eastern
      books. He not only had the book, but he informed her that he also had a large collection of
      books about Sudan for which he was seeking a buyer. I telephoned her immediately, thanked her
      for her efforts and requested her to contact Paul Wilson and inform him that I am interested in
      his collection, and that he should not sell it until I had had a chance of seeing him and it. A
      couple of weeks later I flew to London, took the train to Shrewsbury, met Paul and within a
      couple of hours we had shaken hands on a deal.</span> </blockquote><blockquote
      class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Paul’s collection, at the time, amounted to about 850 books. I
      requested of him that he continue looking to add books, documents, maps and paintings to the
      collection, He has been doing that for me for the last ten years, with the collection now
      boasting approximately 2,000 books, double that number of historical documents, pamphlets and
      maps, paintings and photographs.</span> </blockquote><blockquote
      class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">The idea was to move the whole collection to Sudan after
      securing an appropriate home for it there. But after five years of fruitless search and broken
      promises from the authorities there, I decided to instead loan the Collection to a University
      that provides courses in Sudanese Studies, so that as many scholars can benefit from it as
      possible, rather that for it to remain in boxes in a warehouse in England. The obvious choice
      was the University of Bergen, because of their extensive Sudanese courses and its long and
      close co-operation with Sudanese Universities, especially the University of
      Khartoum.</span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span
      style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">On the last
      day of the conference on Sudanese Studies, which was successfully hosted by the University of
      Bergen in April 2006, I informed my friend Professor Anders Bjorkelo, the Director of The
      Centre for Middle-Eastern and Islamic Studies, of my intention. He was thrilled with the idea
      and obtained the approval of the University within days. Early in June 2006, Paul and I flew to
      Bergen on the same day that the books arrived by truck from Shrewsbury, England.</span>
      </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Collection was received
      with great enthusiasm and appreciation by everybody at the University, from the Rector down to
      the under-graduate students. The books were unpacked and arranged on to their shelves in a room
      provided for their housing at the Centre. The books were made available for study, and the
      University has kindly provided funds for the scanning and digitalising of the books which
      appear on this website, completely free of charge.</span>
      </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">I wish to express my
      appreciation and gratitude to everyone at the University who helped and participated in this
      worthwhile endeavour.</span><br /><span style="font-size:
