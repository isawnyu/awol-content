Once a publication has passed its peer-review  process and has been approved for publication, the author has the option to make  it available through our Gorgias Open repository as well as in a traditional print  format.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Open access publishing is good news for everyone. It combines our scholars’  careful research with our capabilities to polish and independently review  academic work. Best of all, it means that no one is prevented from accessing the  latest information because of lack of funds.

In his view, Islam  grew out of different - albeit rather marginal - Jewish and Christian  traditions. In the present volume, which is dedicated to Wansbrough’s  memory, specialists in Islamic studies and students of the Jewish and  early Christian traditions summarise Wansbrough’s achievements in the  past thirty years and chart the future of the tradition study of the  “sectarian milieu.” </span></div></td><td valign="top" width="50%"><div align="center"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://gorgiaspress.com/bookshop/download/Commentaries,%20Catenae%20and%20Biblical%20Tradition.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="http://gorgiaspress.com/bookshop/images/product/icon/978-1-4632-0576-8.png" vspace="5px" /></a><br /><a href="http://gorgiaspress.com/bookshop/download/Commentaries,%20Catenae%20and%20Biblical%20Tradition.pdf" target="_blank">Download <i>Commentaries, Catenae and Biblical Tradition</i>, Edited by H.

Bergen</a></span></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-size: x-small;">This ground-breaking study offers a reassessment of  Moses' book of the law from a narrative theory perspective. Concerned  for the long-term viability of his people, Moses legislates a public  reading of his document which is deposited next to the ark of the  covenant as a national testament. Through the mechanics of narrative  mediation, the narrator reveals to the reader of Deuteronomy the  contents of Moses' enshrined publication. Deuteronomy's simulcast of  Moses' book invites external readers to compare and evaluate their  readings with story-world readers who access the same text within the  Bible's Primary Narrative.</span></div></td><td valign="top"><div align="center"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://gorgiaspress.com/bookshop/download/Early%20Readers,%20Scholars,%20and%20Editors.pdf" target="_blank"><img alt="Download &lt;i&gt;Early Readers, Scholars, and Editors of the New Testament" height="105" src="http://gorgiaspress.com/bookshop/images/product/icon/978-1-4632-0411-2.png" vspace="5px" width="70" /></a><br /><a href="http://gorgiaspress.com/bookshop/download/Early%20Readers,%20Scholars,%20and%20Editors.pdf" target="_blank">Download <i>Early Readers, Scholars and Editors of the New Testament</i>, edited by H.A.G.
