   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introancientegypt">Introduction to Ancient Egypt and Its Civilization</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong class="body-2-text" data-reactid="106">About this course: </strong>Colossal  pyramids, imposing temples, golden treasures, enigmatic hieroglyphs,  powerful pharaohs, strange gods, and mysterious mummies are features of  Ancient Egyptian culture that have fascinated people over the millennia.   The Bible refers to its gods, rulers, and pyramids. Neighboring  cultures in the ancient Near East and Mediterranean wrote about its  god-like kings and its seemingly endless supply of gold.  The Greeks and  Romans describe aspects of Egypt's culture and history.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">As the 19th century began, the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt highlighted  the wonders of this ancient land, and public interest soared.  Not long  after, Champollion deciphered Egypt's hieroglyphs and paved the way for  other scholars to reveal that Egyptian texts dealt with medicine,  dentistry, veterinary practices, mathematics, literature, and  accounting, and many other topics. Then, early in the 20th century,  Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun and its fabulous  contents. Exhibitions of this treasure a few decades later resulted in  the world's first blockbuster, and its revival in the 21st century has  kept interest alive.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Join Dr. David Silverman, Professor of Egyptology at Penn, Curator in  Charge of the Egyptian Section of the Penn Museum, and curator of the  Tutankhamun exhibitions  on a guided tour of the mysteries and wonders  of this ancient land.  He has developed this online course and set it in  the galleries of the world famous Penn Museum.  He uses many original  Egyptian artifacts to illustrate his lectures as he guides students as  they make their own discovery of this fascinating culture. </span></blockquote>]]></content>
