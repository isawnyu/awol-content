It is primarily aimed at active researchers in public and private organizations, from all research fields in science and the humanities and focuses on publication of research articles in (open access) peer-reviewed journals.<br /><br />If you would like to contribute to shaping the public discourse on open access, please visit <a href="http://surveymonkey.com/soap_survey_d">http://surveymonkey.com/soap_survey_d</a>. It should take 10-15 minutes to complete. We would appreciate if you would share this link with your colleagues and collaborators so that the views of your discipline are properly represented.<br /><br />The survey outcome will be made public and the resulting insights as well as recommendations will be openly shared with the European Commission, publishers, research funding agencies, libraries and researchers.<br /><br />Thanks in advance, the SOAP Project Team info@project-soapSPAMNOT.eu<br /><mailto:info@project-soapspamnot.eu><br /><br />(*) Note: The SOAP consortium is coordinated by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. It represents key stakeholders in open access, such as publishers BioMedCentral, SAGE and Springer; funding agencies (the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council) and<br />libraries (the Max Planck Digital Library of the Max Planck Society).
