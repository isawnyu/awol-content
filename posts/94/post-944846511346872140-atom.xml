   <title type="text">Architecture and Asceticism: Cultural Interaction between Syria and Georgia in Late Antiquity</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://architectureandasceticism.exeter.ac.uk/">Architecture and Asceticism</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://architectureandasceticism.exeter.ac.uk/themes/seasons_modified/images/banner.jpg" class="shrinkToFit" height="36" src="http://architectureandasceticism.exeter.ac.uk/themes/seasons_modified/images/banner.jpg" width="400" /> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div id="homepage_text"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Architecture and Asceticism: Cultural  Interaction between Syria and Georgia in Late Antiquity is a five-year  research project funded by the European Research Council.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The aim of the project is to explore the Georgian belief that  monasticism was brought to the country by the "Thirteen (As)Syrian  Fathers" in the sixth century. As there is no textual evidence still  extant from this early period, the project is evaluating the surviving  material culture in both countries in order to identify any common  movements in architecture and art, as well as to study the  ecclesiastical history of both countries in order to pinpoint  similarities in liturgy, pilgrimage or any other area of historical  ritual practice. It is hoped that data from further afield will be  contributed in the future, but the parameters of the current project  (which will run until November 2017) encompass the modern countries of  Georgia, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian Territories.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011 has meant that no new  field work can be undertaken for this project in that country, but this  has been largely overcome by making use of a large archive of site  images taken by the principal investigator in Syria from 1997 until  2010. Therefore this resource also incorporates material from earlier  research, including data from two archaeological excavations. We are  aware that the ongoing looting and destruction of Syrian archaeological  sites places a moral duty on academics to make available their  unpublished material to the wider research community in order to create a  common resource for those seeking to safeguard Syrian Cultural  Heritage. This web resource is intended as a contribution to this  process.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">Much of this information is being made available to the public for  the first time. We have endeavoured to publish as many papers written by  team members as possible, but where prevented by copyright restrictions  from including articles and monographs we have added links to the  websites where there are abstracts and purchase details of these items.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">Please look at the <a href="http://architectureandasceticism.exeter.ac.uk/contact">Contact Us</a> section if you have any comments or suggestions for the improvement of  this resource. This site is still evolving and we hope that it will  ultimately become a valuable repository for the Late Antique and Early  Medieval material culture of the Levant, Asia Minor and Caucasus  regions.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">            <br /><ul class="navigation"><li class="active">        <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://architectureandasceticism.exeter.ac.uk/">Home</a>    </span></li><li>        <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://architectureandasceticism.exeter.ac.uk/team">Project Team</a></span>    </li><li>        <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://architectureandasceticism.exeter.ac.uk/collections/browse?sort_field=Dublin+Core%2CTitle">Collections</a></span>    </li><li>        <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://architectureandasceticism.exeter.ac.uk/geolocation/map/browse">Map</a></span>    </li><li>        <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://architectureandasceticism.exeter.ac.uk/items/tags/sort_field/name/sort_dir/a">Tags</a></span>    </li><li>        <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://architectureandasceticism.exeter.ac.uk/types">Types</a></span>    </li><li>        <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://architectureandasceticism.exeter.ac.uk/rights">Rights</a></span>    </li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">        <a href="http://architectureandasceticism.exeter.ac.uk/contact">Contact Us</a></span></li></ul></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">And See also: <a href="https://exeter.academia.edu/EmmaLoosley">https://exeter.academia.edu/EmmaLoosley</a> </div>]]></content>
