      x-small;"><i>Classics@</i>, edited by a team working for the Center for Hellenic
      Studies and headed by Gregory Nagy and James O'Donnell, is designed to bring contemporary
      classical scholarship to a wide audience on the World Wide Web. Each issue will be dedicated to
      its own topic, often with guest editors, for an in-depth exploration of important current
      problems in the field of Classics. We hope that <i>Classics@</i> will appeal not
      only to professional classicists, but also to the intellectually curious who are willing to
      enter the conversation in our discipline. We hope that they find that classical scholarship
      engages issues of great significance to a wide range of cultural and scholarly concerns and
      does so in a rigorous and challenging way.</span><br /><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Each issue of <i>Classics@</i> is meant to be not
      static but dynamic, continuing to evolve with interaction from its readers as participants. New
      issues will appear when the editors think there is good material to offer. Often it will
      emphasize work done in and through the Center for Hellenic Studies, but it will also call
      attention to fresh and interesting work presented elsewhere on the web. It stresses the
      importance of research-in-progress, encouraging collegial debate (while discouraging polemics
      for the sake of polemics) as well as the timely sharing of important new
      information</span>.<br /><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Issue

      11: The Rhetoric of Abuse in Greek Literature</a>. This volume grew out of the need for a
      venue in which to engage collaboratively on the topic of abuse. Abuse has of course been widely
      studied, and in the last few years there has been a renewed interest in abuse as a broader
      cultural and literary phenomenon, but there are reasonable restrictions as to how it has been
      addressed. One goal of this volume is to initiate a scholarly discussion that will allow
      greater heterogeneity in the material covered and in the theoretical models brought to bear on
      that material. Another is to encourage experimentation and collaborative exchange among
      scholars working in seemingly unconnected fields. Most importantly, perhaps, we would like to
      foster a deeper understanding of the role of abuse in all of Greek literature, across genres
      and time periods, through the kind of cumulative knowledge that comes from collaborative work
      in different fields.</span><br /><span style="font-size:

      Issue 10: Historical Poetics in Nineteenth and Twentieth Century Greece: Essays in Honor of
      Lily Macrakis</a>. History needs art to give it form; art needs history to give it
      resonance. This relationship of history and art is the theme of the essays by distinguished
      international scholars collected in this volume. Its publication celebrates the career and work
      of Professor Lily Macrakis. She is an eminent chronicler of modern Greek history whose seminal
      work, <em>Venizelos: A Study in Cretan Leadership</em><span>, remains
      essential to an understanding of the most influential Greek leader of the 20th century. Among
      her other accomplishments, Professor Macrakis was president of The Modern Greek Studies
      Association from 1977 to 1979 and has been an influential figure in the organization since its
      inception. Equally significant has been her role as a devoted teacher of Greek history and
      culture to multitudes of students. Professor Macrakis thus truly embodies the spirit and
      significance of the articles presented in this Festschrift so fittingly dedicated to
      her.</span></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">

      9: Defense Mechanisms in Interdisciplinary Approaches to Classical Studies and
      Beyond</a>. Nowadays people speak of “defense mechanisms” as both negative and positive
      forms of behavior: examples of negative forms are denial, repression, acting out, projection,
      rationalization, intellectualization, while one of the few positive forms is assertion, a way
      of responding that takes the middle ground between aggressive and passive. In the spirit of
      this positive form of assertion and in both technical and non-technical senses of the
      expression “defense mechanisms,” the present issue of Classics@ has been given its title. The
      aim is to publish online research papers and essays in Classics and in other disciplines,
      related or unrelated, that explore strategies where the primary purpose is to defend
      assertively rather than attack. The justification is straightforward: discoveries and discovery
      procedures in research require and deserve a reasoned defense.</span><br /><span

      the recent publication of the edition by Theokritos Kouremenos, George M. Parássoglou, and
      Kyriakos Tsantsanoglou (Florence, Olschki, 2006; the text of the papyrus from that edition is

      The symposium was an opportunity to gather scholars who in the course of the past decades have
      been working on this text to address a set of issues relating to the edition and integration of
      the papyrus, its translation, and its interpretation.</span><br /><span

      4: The New Sappho on Old Age: Textual and Philosophical Issues</a> is the online edition
      of a print volume published by the Center for Hellenic Studies in 2009 (available through
      Harvard University Press, <a
      href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?recid=29507">here</a>). This volume is
      the first collection of essays in English devoted to discussion of the newly-recovered Sappho
      poem and two other incomplete texts on the same papyri. Containing eleven new essays by leading
      scholars, it addresses a wide range of textual and philological issues connected with the find.
      Using different approaches, the contributions demonstrate how the "New Sappho" can be
      appreciated as a gracefully spare poetic statement regarding the painful inevitability of death
      and aging. Guest Editors: Ellen Greene and Marilyn B. Skinner.</span></div><span
