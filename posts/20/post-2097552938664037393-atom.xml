      x-small;"><a href="http://www.midafternoonmap.com/">Afternoon Map</a> is excited
      to announce its first publication / spinoff website, the <a
      href="http://royalasiaticsocietyofbengal.blogspot.com/">Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal
      Reader</a>. Available as a shoddily made <a
      href="http://royalasiaticsocietyofbengal.blogspot.com/p/pdf-download.html">PDF</a> as
      well, the Royal Asiatic Reader features highlights from mid-nineteenth century issues of the
      Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal that have been digitized by Google Books, with a
      particular emphasis on the esoteric, absurd, obscene, mystifying, offensive and poetic. I've
      always been fascinated by the articles that appeared in this Journal, not only because they
      make such entertaining reading (if only for the same kinds of people who like to look at old
      maps), but also because they seem to so perfectly illustrate the relationship between
      geographic knowledge and imperial power so well, if abstractly, documented in
      <i>Orientalism</i>. At the same time, while I hope this collection can serve as an
      introduction for students knew to the study of the region, I think it also offers a valuable
      lesson for those of us already familiar with the subject. Specifically, the immense learning
      that went into much of this writing shows that, rather than dismiss orientalist scholarship
      with casual disdain, we should remain constantly mindful of the fact that scholars much smarter
      and more hard working than ourselves have fallen prey to gross ideological biases, and strive
      to make sure we don't do the same.</span></blockquote><br /><div
