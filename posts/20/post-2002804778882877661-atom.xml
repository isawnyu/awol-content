    <title type="text">Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) updates</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Late last week, the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) added three
      new data sets:<br /><br />From announcements circulated by CDLI:<br
      /><span style="font-family:'PrimaSans
      BT,Verdana,sans-serif';"></span><blockquote><span
      style=";font-family:'PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif';font-size:85%;" >Images of nearly all
      <a href="http://starturl.com/eetdl">mathematical tablets kept at Jena</a> are now
      available online through the CDLI database. The images were produced as part of the publication
      <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/277194988">Tablettes math√©matiques de la collection
      Hilprecht</a> (C. Proust with the collaboration of M. Krebernik and J. Oelsner) = TMH 8
      (2008), and were batch-processed to CDLI standard format by UCLA staff.<br /><br
      /><a href="http://starturl.com/aislx">New images of mathematical tablets from Nippur
      kept at Istanbul</a> have also been added to CDLI. Like the Jena files, the photographs
      of the Istanbul texts prepared for CD insertion in the publication <a
      href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/277194988">Tablettes mathematiques de Nippur</a>
      (C. Proust; 2007) were processed for web at UCLA...<span style="text-decoration:
      underline;"></span><br /><br />Please see Proust, "<a
      href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlj/2009/cdlj2009_001.html">Numerical and Metrological
      Graphemes: From Cuneiform to Transliteration</a>," CDLJ 2009/1, for a description of
      plans to include, in the standard format of an alliance of online cuneiform projects led by
      CDLI and ePSD, transliterations of all cuneiform metrological and mathematical
      texts.</span></blockquote>and<br /><span style="font-family:'PrimaSans
      BT,Verdana,sans-serif';"></span><blockquote><span
      style=";font-family:'PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif';font-size:85%;" >The Cuneiform Digital
      Library Initiative, in partnership with the <a
      href="http://www.egyptianmuseum.org/">Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum</a> in San Jose,
      California, is pleased to announce the addition of new digital content to its web
      offerings.<br /><br />In March of this year, two UCLA staff members of the project
      (Brumfield and Heinle) scanned 148 San Jose tablets, and processed the tablet surface images
      according to CDLI's "fat-cross" standards to complement the SET (<a
      href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/322429">Sumerian Economic Texts from the Third Ur
      Dynasty</a>) publication of Rosicrucian and other US tablet collections published in 1961
      by Tom B. Jones and John W. Snyder in transliteration only; collations of the REM tablets in
      SET were subsequently published by M. Cooper in 1986 (ASJ 8, 309-344) and by J. Carnahan and K.
      Hillard in 1993 and 1994 (ASJ 15, 246-251; ASJ 16, 310). Bob Englund posted these images to web
      this week; the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/qra8u7">entire REM collection can be accessed
      here</a>.<br /><br />This digital imaging was supported by a National
      Leadership Grant for Libraries - Building Digital Resources from the Institute of Museum and
      Library Services, and is part of the on-going mission of CDLI to ensure the long-term
      preservation of texts inscribed on endangered cuneiform tablets, and to provide free global
      access to all available text artifact data in furtherance of cuneiform
      research.</span><br /></blockquote><a
      href="http://www.cdli.ucla.edu/"><strong>The Cuneiform Digital Library
      Initiative</strong> (CDLI)</a> represents the efforts of an international group of
      Assyriologists, museum curators and historians of science to make available through the
      internet the form and content of cuneiform tablets dating from the beginning of writing, ca.
      3350 BC, until the end of the pre-Christian era. We estimate the number of these documents
      currently kept in public and private collections to exceed 500,000 exemplars, of which now
      nearly 225,000 have been catalogued in electronic form by the CDLI.<br /><br />CDLI
      also produces a variety of other essential resources.<br /><br />Three
