      x-small;">CORONA is the codename for the United States’ first photographic spy satellite
      mission, in operation from 1960-1972. During that time, CORONA satellites took high-resolution
      images of most of the earth’s surface, with particular emphasis on Soviet bloc countries and
      other political hotspots in order to monitor military sites and produce maps for the Department
      of Defense. The more than 800,000 images collected by the CORONA missions remained classified
      until 1995 when an executive order by President Bill Clinton made them publicly available
      through the <a
      href="http://eros.usgs.gov/#/Find_Data/Products_and_Data_Available/Declassified_Satellite_Imagery_-_1"
      target="_blank">US Geological Survey</a>. Because CORONA images preserve a
      high-resolution picture of the world as it existed in the 1960s, they constitute a unique
      resource for researchers and scientists studying environmental change, agriculture,
      geomorphology, archaeology and other fields. <br /><br />In regions like the Middle
      East, CORONA imagery is particularly important for archaeology because urban development,
      agricultural intensification, and reservoir construction over the past several decades have
      obscured or destroyed countless archaeological sites and other ancient features such as roads
      and canals. These sites are often clearly visible on CORONA imagery, enabling researchers to
      map sites that have been lost and to discover many that have never before been documented.
      However, the unique imaging geometry of the CORONA satellite cameras, which produced long,
      narrow film strips, makes correcting spatial distortions in the images very challenging and has
      therefore limited their use by researchers. </span><span style="font-size:

      Endowment for the Humanities</a> and the <a href="http://www.acls.org/"
      target="_blank">American Council of Learned Societies</a>, the <a

      Advanced Spatial Technologies (<a href="http://cast.uark.edu/"
      target="_blank">CAST</a>) has developed methods for efficient orthorectification of
      CORONA imagery and now provides free public access to our imagery database for non-commercial
      use. Images can be viewed online and full resolution images can be downloaded in GeoTiff or
      NITF formats. <br /><br /><b>IMAGERY</b></span> <span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><br /><br />This project focuses on the Middle East
      and surrounding regions, areas where CORONA coverage is abundant and where its value to
      archaeology and other fields has been well-demonstrated. The large majority of the images we
      provide come from the KH4B satellites, the latest generation of CORONA missions in operation
      from September 1967 through May 1972. During this time, there were sixteen successful CORONA
      missions, designated 1101-1117 which recovered more than 188000 images. These satellites were
      equipped with two panoramic cameras, one facing forward and another aft with a 30º angle of
      separation, producing an approximate ground resolution of 6 feet (1.8m) at nadir as well as
      offering the capability for stereo-viewing and the extraction of topographic data. Images were
      originally recorded on black-and-white film, copies of which are curated by the USGS EROS Data
      Center. The USGS has scanned the images at 7 micron (3600 dpi) resolution. Additional technical
      details regarding the CORONA program and image characteristics can be read
      </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a
      href="http://eros.usgs.gov/#/Guides/disp1" target="_blank">here</a>. <br
      /><br />Cameras on different CORONA missions produced images that vary a great deal in
      quality, while many images suffer from cloud cover, atmospheric haze or other issues. For
      imagery which we purchased, we have concentrated on providing the greatest possible regional
      extent, as opposed to multiple images of the same area, and have also sought to offer stereo
      coverage wherever possible. Imagery purchased for this project has been supplemented by images
      purchased for other projects or those shared with us by colleagues, notably the Center for
      Archaeology of the Middle Eastern Landscape (</span><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><a href="http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/camel/"
      target="_blank">CAMEL</a>) and the University of Chicago’s <a
      href="http://oi.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Oriental Institute</a>. <br
      /><br />Our work has been largely dedicated to developing methods for
      orthorectification of CORONA imagery. The technical aspects of this process are described in a
      forthcoming paper: Jackson Cothren, Jesse Casana, Tuna Kalayci and Adam Barnes, “An efficient
      method for rigorous orthorectification of CORONA satellite imagery” International Journal of
      Remote Sensing. </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /><br
