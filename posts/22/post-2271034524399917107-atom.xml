   <title type="text">Corona Atlas &amp; Referencing System</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: xx-small;">[Firsts posted in AWOL 3 December 2011, updated 17 January 2017]</span><br /><a href="http://corona.cast.uark.edu/"><br /></a><a href="http://corona.cast.uark.edu/">Corona Atlas &amp; Referencing System</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">CORONA is the codename for the United States’ first photographic spy  satellite mission, in operation from 1960-1972.  During that time,  CORONA satellites took high-resolution images of most of the earth’s  surface, with particular emphasis on Soviet bloc countries and other  political hotspots in order to monitor military sites and produce maps  for the Department of Defense.  The more than 800,000 images collected  by the CORONA missions remained classified until 1995 when an executive  order by President Bill Clinton made them publicly available through the                  <a href="http://eros.usgs.gov/#/Find_Data/Products_and_Data_Available/Declassified_Satellite_Imagery_-_1" target="_blank">US Geological Survey</a>.   Because CORONA images preserve a high-resolution picture of the world  as it existed in the 1960s, they constitute a unique resource for  researchers and scientists studying environmental change, agriculture,  geomorphology, archaeology and other fields.                  <br />               <br />               In regions like the Middle East, CORONA imagery is  particularly important for archaeology because urban development,  agricultural intensification, and reservoir construction over the past  several decades have obscured or destroyed countless archaeological  sites and other ancient features such as roads and canals.  These sites  are often clearly visible on CORONA imagery, enabling researchers to map  sites that have been lost and to discover many that have never before  been documented.  However, the unique imaging geometry of the CORONA  satellite cameras, which produced long, narrow film strips, makes  correcting spatial distortions in the images very challenging and has  therefore limited their use by researchers.                  <br />               <br />               Thanks to grants from the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/" target="_blank">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> and the <a href="http://www.acls.org/" target="_blank">American Council of Learned Societies</a>, the <a href="http://www.uark.edu/" target="_blank">University of Arkansas</a>’ Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (<a href="http://cast.uark.edu/" target="_blank">CAST</a>)  has developed methods for efficient orthorectification of CORONA  imagery and now provides free public access to our imagery database for  non-commercial use.  Images can be viewed online and full resolution  images can be downloaded in NITF format.                <br />               <br />               <b>IMAGERY</b>               <br />               <br />               This project's initial focus was on the Middle East and  surrounding regions, areas where CORONA coverage is abundant and where  its value to archaeology and other fields has been well-demonstrated.   The large majority of the images we provide come from the KH4B  satellites, the latest generation of CORONA missions in operation from  September 1967 through May 1972.  During this time, there were sixteen  successful CORONA missions, designated 1101 through 1117 which recovered  more than 188000 images.  These satellites were equipped with two  panoramic cameras, one facing forward and another aft with a 30º angle  of separation, producing an approximate ground resolution of 6 feet  (1.8m) at nadir as well as offering the capability for stereo-viewing  and the extraction of topographic data.  Images were originally recorded  on black-and-white film, copies of which are curated by the USGS EROS  Data Center.  The USGS has scanned the images at 7 micron (3600 dpi)  resolution.  Additional technical details regarding the CORONA program  and image characteristics can be read <a href="http://eros.usgs.gov/#/Guides/disp1" target="_blank">here</a>.                <br />               <br />               Cameras on different CORONA missions produced images that  vary a great deal in quality, while many images suffer from cloud  cover, atmospheric haze or other issues.  For imagery which we  purchased, we have concentrated on providing the greatest possible  regional extent, as opposed to multiple images of the same area, and  have also sought to offer stereo coverage wherever possible.  Imagery  purchased for this project has been supplemented by images purchased for  other projects or those shared with us by colleagues, notably the  Center for Archaeology of the Middle Eastern Landscape (<a href="http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/camel/" target="_blank">CAMEL</a>) and the University of Chicago’s <a href="http://oi.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Oriental Institute</a>.                  <br />               <br />               Our work has been largely dedicated to developing methods  for orthorectification of CORONA imagery.  The technical aspects of  this process are described in a forthcoming paper:                Jackson Cothren, Jesse Casana, Tuna Kalayci and Adam  Barnes, “An efficient method for rigorous orthorectification of CORONA  satellite imagery” International Journal of Remote Sensing.                <br />               <br />               Images from our database reproduced in publications,  presentations or online should be credited to: Center for Advanced  Spatial Technologies, University of Arkansas/U.S. Geological Survey&nbsp;            </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="header-navbar"><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li class="active">                            <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a data-click="scroll-to-target" data-toggle="dropdown" href="http://corona.cast.uark.edu/#home">HOME</a>                        </span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a data-click="scroll-to-target" href="http://corona.cast.uark.edu/#about">ABOUT</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a data-click="scroll-to-target" href="http://corona.cast.uark.edu/#basics">BASICS</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a data-click="scroll-to-target" href="http://corona.cast.uark.edu/#layers">LAYERS</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a data-click="scroll-to-target" href="http://corona.cast.uark.edu/#tools">TOOLS</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a data-click="scroll-to-target" href="http://corona.cast.uark.edu/#imagery">IMAGERY</a></span></li></ul></div></blockquote><br /><div style="text-align: center;">And see AWOL's <a href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2012/09/roundup-of-resources-on-ancient.html">Roundup of Resources on Ancient Geography</a> </div>]]></content>
