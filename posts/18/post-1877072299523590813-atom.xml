      tutorials without being connected to the internet, Release 1.5 has been prepared as a ZIP
      archive that may be downloaded. The archive is about 20MB and will expand to over 50MB on your

      x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color:

      MODULES</span></span></span></h2><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color:
      #993300;">About the two versions:</span>As of January 15, 2013, only the Unicode
      version is hosted here, and this site is tailored to the first edition of the textbook. The
      older (pre-Unicode, GreekKeys) version has been removed. If you are using the second edition of
      the textbook, then you should go to the revised version of this site, located at <a
      href="http://atticgreek.org/"
      target="_blank">http://atticgreek.org</a>.&nbsp;</span></span><br
      /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family:
      inherit;"><span style="color: #993300;">Pronunciation Guide</span> provides
      information and examples for the pronunciation of the sounds of ancient Attic Greek. Text-based
      in Unicode version, image-based in GreekKeys version. Sounds are embedded and preloaded in
      Unicode version, individually downloaded in older
      version.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color:
      #993300;">Pronunciation Practice</span> provides examples of pronunciation of over 100
      basic Greek words (taken from the early chapters of the textbook referred to under <a
      href="http://ucbclassics.dreamhosters.com/ancgreek/welcomeU.html#credits">Credits</a>
      below). Text-based in Unicode version, image-based in GreekKeys version. Sounds are embedded
      and preloaded in Unicode version, individually downloaded in older
      version.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color:
      #993300;">Accentuation Tutorial</span> presents information and examples to help in
      the understanding and mastery of the accentuation system of ancient Attic Greek. Text-based in
      Unicode version, image-based in GreekKeys version.&nbsp;</span></span><br
      /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family:
      inherit;"><span style="color: #993300;">Accentuation Practice</span> presents
      interactive exercises to test and develop mastery of the accentuation system of ancient Attic
      Greek. Identical in both versions, with image-based Greek in the
      exercises.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /> <span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color:
      #993300;">Principal Parts</span> presents various drills for principal parts (the full
      set of principal parts of over 250 verbs in the textbook are available; random drills and
      drills by alphabetic set and verb type set are also available). Identical in both versions,
      with image-based Greek.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /> <span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color:
      #993300;">Vocabulary</span> presents over 1000 basic words of Greek vocabulary, with
      choice of mode of action (study mode or drill mode, Greek to English or English to Greek) and
      drill by alphabetic and random sets as well as by units. Text-based in Unicode and GreekKeys
      versions.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /> <span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color:
      #993300;">Verb Drill</span> presents Greek verb forms for identification. There are
      about 1500 verb forms in the database. In addition to drill by unit (matched to the book, but
      providing more forms than in the Exercises), drill by random set and drill by sets defined by
      type of form are available. Text-based in Unicode and GreekKeys
      versions.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /> <span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color:
      #993300;">Noun Drill</span> is a shorthand name for a declensional drill including
      forms of nouns, adjectives, and pronouns. There are about 900 forms in the database. In
      addition to drill by unit (matched to the book, but providing more forms than in the
      Exercises), drill by random set and drill by sets defined by type of form are available.
      Text-based in Unicode and GreekKeys versions.&nbsp;</span></span><br
      /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family:
      inherit;"><span style="color: #993300;">English-Greek</span> provides drill in
      composing Greek inflectional forms, using an on-screen keyboard (or in the Unicode version,
      there is an option of direct input from the user's physical keyboard). There are over 800 forms
      available. Some of the items correspond to similar exercises in the book, but there are also
      many forms not in the printed exercises. Two modes of drill are available. In the more
      elementary mode, the user's entry is corrected letter by letter, and it is not possible to go
      on to the subsequent letter until the current letter is correct. In the more challenging mode,
      the user enters the whole answer and then asks to be checked; if the answer is wrong, some
      guidance is given as to the error and the user can try to fix the answer or ask to see the
      answer. Text-based in Unicode version and in GreekKeys
      versions.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /> <span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color:
      #993300;">Paradigms</span> presents verb paradigms and noun, adjective, and pronoun
      paradigms. Text-based in Unicode version (html), image-based in GreekKeys version
      (PDF).&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size:
