</div><div class="whole" id="AboutBook">			<h2 class="BD-Hide"><span style="font-size: x-small;">About the Book</span></h2><span style="font-size: x-small;">	The <em>Republic of Plato </em>is one of the classic gateway texts into  the study and practice of philosophy, and it is just the sort of book  that has been able to arrest and redirect lives. How it has been able to  do this, and whether or not it will be able to do this in your own  case, is something you can only discover for yourself. The present  guidebook aims to help a person get fairly deep, fairly quickly, into  the project. It divides the dialogue into 96 sections and provides  commentary on each section as well as questions for reflection and  exploration. It is organized with a table of contents and is stitched  together with a system of navigating bookmarks. Links to external sites  such as the Perseus Classical Library are used throughout. This book is  suitable for college courses or independent study.</span><br />  	    </div><div class="whole" id="AboutContributors">	        <h2 id="authors"><span style="font-size: x-small;">About the Contributors</span></h2><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Author(s)</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Douglas Drabkin </strong>graduated from the University of  Virginia in 1993 with degrees in literature, education, and philosophy,  and has been a member of the department since 1994. He teaches a wide  range of courses including Introduction to Philosophy, Bioethics, Aims  of Education, Classical Greek Philosophy, Foundations of Modern  Philosophy, and Aesthetics, and is currently involved in the Living and  Learning Community Heart and Mind: Philosophizing About the Arts. He has  published articles in the philosophy of religion, and has recently  written an unusually good little book on Plato’s Republic. A fairly  accomplished amateur violinist, he shamelessly scrapes away.</span><br />  		</div></div></blockquote><br class="clearfloat" />        ]]></content>
