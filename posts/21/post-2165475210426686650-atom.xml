      Statement on Open Access to Scholarly Publishing in the UK</a><br /><blockquote
      class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Open Access (OA) to
      Scholarly Publishing in the UK<br /> </strong>Comments submitted by<br />
      <strong>The American Philological Association
      </strong>(<strong>APA</strong>)<br /> Denis Feeney, President
      (dfeeney@princeton.edu)<br /> Michael Gagarin, Vice President for Publication and
      Research (gagarin@austin.utexas.edu)<br /> <br /> The APA, the principal learned
      society representing scholars and teachers of Classics located primarily in the US and Canada,
      is strongly committed to OA as a goal for all publication and research in the area of Classics.
      We recognize, however, that the move to OA raises complex and difficult issues, and we thus
      welcome the proposals made in the Finch Report to address these issues, many of which would be
      positive steps in the direction of OA. At the same time, the Finch report raises some
      significant concerns, which in our view must be addressed in any plan for implementing their
      recommendations. Many of these stem from the fact that the report views OA primarily as it
      affects medical and scientific research. Because conditions affecting the social sciences and
      humanities differ in several significant respects, we are concerned about the negative effects
      on research in Classics in the US and abroad.<br /> <br /> 1. Most research in
      Classics is single-author, and either is not funded or is funded by grants or fellowships that
      only provide relief from teaching; this leaves no consistent funding for author publishing
      charges (APCs). Requiring researchers to pay to have their work published would seriously
      burden those who are poor or not connected to a well-endowed institution; any system that
      favors the rich could significantly reduce the quality of journal publications.<br />
      <br /> 2. Publication in the form of monographs or collections of essays is much more
      important in the social sciences and humanities than in the sciences. In Classics in
      particular, the proliferation of essay collections in the last few decades has meant that many
      senior scholars -- those with the best access to APC funds -- rarely if ever publish in
      refereed journals. Journals would therefore be left to recover the costs of publishing almost
      entirely from younger scholars, who are least able to pay.<br /> We mention as a footnote
      that an experiment, funded by the Mellon Foundation, is underway in the US for an OA monograph
      series; it is too early to predict the results.<br /> <br /> 3. Classics, like many
      humanistic fields, is broadly international; indeed a good many APA members are housed in other
      countries, including the UK. Many journals publish articles in more than one language and
      scholars everywhere publish their work with presses and journals in many other countries. Any
      movement to OA in the UK alone, especially if a requirement for OA is included in future
      Research Assessments, would restrict the ability of UK scholars to have their work published,
      reduce the submission of papers to UK journals by non-UK scholars, and discourage journals in
      other countries from publishing the work of UK scholars. The harm done to the international
      exchange of ideas in Classics would be notable.<br /> <br /> 4.For all of these
      reasons, we strongly support the Conclusion of the British Academy's submission to the House of
      Lords Select Committee, that the special circumstances of the humanities and social sciences be
      particularly considered in planning the implementation of the proposed OA policies.
