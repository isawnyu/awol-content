   <title type="text">Moldovan Family Holy Land Map Collection</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/moldovanmaps/index.cfm">Moldovan Family Holy Land Map Collection</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/moldovanmaps/title_text.png" class="transparent" src="http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/moldovanmaps/title_text.png" /> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/CSS/Global_Images/SCETIcollectionlogo.gif" class="transparent" src="http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/CSS/Global_Images/SCETIcollectionlogo.gif" /> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Moldovan family Holy Land Map Collection was built over several  decades by Dr. Alfred Moldovan and his family.  It consists of 94  discrete maps dating from 1480-1797, printed in 23 distinct locations  across Europe.  The majority of the maps were printed in the 17th and  18th centuries in Amsterdam, Antwerp, Basel, Lyon, Paris, Rome,  Strassburg, Tuebingen, and Venice. There are over fifty cartographers  and engravers represented, including Adrichem, Bunting, Calmet, Hole,  Mercator, Munster, Ortelius, Visscher, Wit, and Ziegler. It also  features the unique surviving copy of <a href="http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/moldovanmaps/about.cfm#">Antonio De Angelis’s map of Jerusalem</a>,  printed in Rome in 1578.  The map, the first view of Jerusalem based on  direct observation and a key source for subsequent Holy Land  cartography, was discovered by Dr. Moldovan and subsequently published  in a study by him in 1983 in an article entitled  “The Lost De Angelis  Map of Jerusalem, 1578" in The Map Collector vol. 24 (1983), 17-25,<br /><a href="http://www.artwis.com/articles/the-lost-de-angelis-map-of-jerusalem-1578/" target="_blank">http://www.artwis.com/articles/the-lost-de-angelis-map-of-jerusalem-1578/</a> )<br /><br />These digital facsimiles were presented to the Penn Libraries in 2009 by  Dr. Alfred Moldovan, one of the world’s foremost Judaica collectors  over the last half-century and an expert on the authentici­ty of Jewish  ceremonial art.  He was born on the East side of New York in 1921 to  immigrant, Yiddish-speaking parents.&nbsp; During World War II, he served in  Italy as a Captain and a Radar Officer in the 455th Bom­bardment Group  of the Fifteenth Air Force. On returning to the United States, he  attend­ed medical school on the G.I. Bill, joined the Communist Party  and received permission to fulfill his mobilization service as a fam­ily  doctor in East Harlem, which kept him busy for over fifty years.</span>  </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">&nbsp; <a href="http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/moldovanmaps/index.cfm">Home</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/moldovanmaps/about.cfm">About</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/moldovanmaps/maps_title.cfm">View the Maps</a></span></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">And see AWOL'S <a href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2012/09/roundup-of-resources-on-ancient.html">Roundup of Resources on Ancient Geography</a></span></span></span></span> </div>]]></content>
