      x-small;">Somewhere in the mid-19th century, the word “Egyptology” was coined: The name
      connotes the scientific study of ancient Egyptian history, language, literature, religion,
      architecture and art from the 5th millennium BC until the end of the 4th century AD.&nbsp;
      Some 165 years later, Egyptology has become part of history, and now there is a movement afoot
      to investigate and study its evolution.</span> </blockquote><blockquote
      class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The&nbsp;<strong>t3.wy
      Project </strong>has been a frontrunner in this field: In June 2009, with the aid of a
      small staff, Marcel and Monica Maessen set up a website to draw attention to the subject of
      Egyptian dig houses.&nbsp; These houses, scattered all over Egypt, are where the first
      Egyptologists spent their professional as well as their private lives while excavating in
      Egypt. These houses were usually built close to their work, and therefore their histories
      contain much information about the excavations and also about the people who lived
      there.</span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">This specific subject ánd the accompanying website provoked an
      outpouring of interest from academics and the general public alike. As a result, it was decided
      to take this private project to the next level by starting a non-profit Foundation. The t3.wy
      Foundation, as it will be called for short, was established on July 4., 2014. The reason for
      establishing a Foundation was to raise much-needed funds enabling the team to continue and
      expand in-depth research on dig houses and other topics, directly related to the history of
      Egyptology. Since the Foundation will be based in the Netherlands, it also has a Dutch name,
      “<em>Stichting </em>t3.wy<em> Historisch Onderzoek Egyptologie</em>”.
      In English: “<em>The </em>t3.wy<em> Foundation for Historical Research in
      Egyptology</em>”</span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><em>Project
      Goals:</em></strong></span> </blockquote><blockquote
      class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Travellers and scientists began to
      visit Egypt many centuries ago, and when they left, a lot of information left the country with
      them. We are not only talking about the obvious objects leaving the country to wind up in
      museums, universities and private collections all over the world, but also about photographic
      evidence and correspondence. Unfortunately, many of these valuable pieces of information were
      never documented, studied or published. In fact, thousands of letters and photographic evidence
      are stored in museum archives, while hundreds of thousands object languish in storehouses, some
      still in the original box or crate they arrived in. Lack of interest, funds and/or manpower has
      prevented specialists from giving the objects the attention they deserved. Research associated
      with the history of Egyptology can be useful in helping track down the original location of
      unplaced objects and bring them to light. Besides that, Research associated with history of
      Egyptology can also shed lights on other aspects, such as: The Egyptologist’s social life;
      Context between Ancient artefacts, which has been overlooked until now, the way of constructing
      houses in Egypt and the influence foreigners had on this, etc.</span>
      </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Not
      unlike Egyptology itself, the history of Egyptology potentially has many different aspects that
      could be researched. For the time being, <strong><em>the
      </em></strong><strong><em>t3.wy</em></strong><strong><em>
      Foundation for Historical Research in Egyptology</em></strong>focuses its attention
      to the following three subjects:</span><br /><ol><li><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">The research, description and publication of dig houses in
      Egypt, DHP (<strong><em>D</em></strong>ig
      <strong><em>H</em></strong>ouse
      <strong><em>P</em></strong>roject),</span></li><li><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Discovering, researching, describing and, if necessary,
      restoring historical photographs and (glass) negatives and slides of Egyptian antiquities,
      HPRPP (<strong><em>H</em></strong>istorical
      <strong><em>P</em></strong>hoto
      <strong><em>R</em></strong>esearch &amp;
      <strong><em>P</em></strong>reservation
      <strong><em>P</em></strong>roject),</span></li><li><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Investigating and publishing correspondence from Egyptologists
      from the mid-19<sup>th</sup> to the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, ECP
      (<strong><em>E</em></strong>gyptologist
      <strong><em>C</em></strong>orrespondence
      <strong><em>P</em></strong>roject).</span></li></ol><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">In due time – and this part of the project would rely heavily on
      funding – the Foundation would like to set up the jewel in its crown: AIPP, <em>the
      <strong>A</strong>ntiquities <strong>I</strong>nventory and
      <strong>P</strong>ublication <strong>P</strong>roject</em>, in
      which we would like to bring together all those “forgotten” objects, at one time brought from
      Egypt and “dropped” al over the world in Museums and bring them together in one central
      database for scholars to be studied. Since this would require efforts beyond the&nbsp; –
      current – capabilities of the Foundation, we will not start with this project immediately, but
      gradually start working on it.</span></blockquote><div class="col-md-12
