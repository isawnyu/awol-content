      x-small;">Ever wondered how it felt for a Roman to be in a sanctuary at a time when it was
      still fully operational? To attend a religious ritual? Or to place an object there, to dedicate
      it, and to ask the gods for something good to happen to you, or say your thanks for something
      good you had received?</span> <br /><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">These were all questions we wanted to provide answers for when we embarked on our
      project “Speculum Dianae [Latin for: Mirror of Diana]. Nemi at Nottingham”; a project in the
      shape of a <a href="http://www.speculum-dianae.nottingham.ac.uk/" title="speculum-dianae
      website">website</a> which uses modern tools, pod casts and digital greeting cards, to
      generate a virtual temple and bring ancient experiences closer to our own modern perceptions.
      We, that are: Ann Inscker from the Nottingham Castle Museums and Galleries; and from the
      University of Nottingham Damian Schofield, Jez Noond, Jack March (School of Computer Science),
      and myself (Department of Classics)...</span><br /><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">...For the Nemi website, we focused our different approaches on
      the objective to show our audience how people see ‑ in our case the Romans, Lord Savile, and we
      ourselves as modern interpreters – and how they experience the world which surrounds them. At
      its core is the attempt to single out segments of this experience of seeing and understanding
      ancient material, and in this specific case an ancient sanctuary. By working through these
      segments, you can construct an experience of the sanctuary which re-enacts to a certain degree
      the one an ancient visitor to the site would have had. At the same time however, you can also
      experience all the variables, necessities for assumptions and deductions from current practices
      that form the basis of modern archaeological research.</span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><br />In doing this, we wanted to move away from an
      absolute reconstruction, allowing you to experiment with multiple interpretations of the
      evidence. This is meant to maintain the critical distance to the reconstruction of the site – a
      distance missing from many modern 3D reconstructions which frequently replace historical
      uncertainty with impressive computer-generated reconstructions, and critical analysis with a
      ‘seeing is believing’ attitude which negates what this very process of seeing actually
      incorporates... [<a
