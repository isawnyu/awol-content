      Amarna Project</a><br /><img alt="Wooden Head from Amarna"

      style="float: right; margin-left: 6px;" /> <br /><blockquote><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">The ancient Egyptian city of Amarna. was the short-lived capital
      built by the Pharaoh Akhenaten and abandoned shortly after his death (c. 1332 BCE). It is of
      particular significance as it represents both the location of the first major society dedicated
      to the cult of a single god as well as an important city that was occupied for a relatively
      brief period and then abandoned. It is thus simultaneously the key to a chapter in the history
      of religious experience and to a fuller understanding of what it was like to be an ancient
      Egyptian. More information on Amarna can be found in Kemp 1977; 1995; 2002 and
      2005.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">The objects in the archive have been recovered over the various
      seasons of fieldwork. The digitisation of the materials was performed as part of the Virtual
      Amarna Project funded by the Amarna Trust.
      </span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">More
      information on Amarna can be found at <a
      href="http://www.amarnaproject.com/">http://www.amarnaproject.com/</a>.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">The datasets in this section of the archive resulted from the 3D
      digitization of the objects using a Konica Minolta Vivid 9i system, Technical details on the
      process are provided in the associated Internet Archaeology article (Limp et al 2011, see
      below). Comprehensive metadata on the objects follow that specified in the new <a
      href="http://guides.archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/g2gp/LaserScan_Toc">Laser Scanning Guide to
      Good Practice</a>. Data formats provided in the archive are: </span><br
      /><ol><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Images - these are standard
      digital photographs provided as jpg files.</span></li><li><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">3D PDF files - 3D PDF is an Adobe Acrobat file format and files
      in this format can be read by the free Adobe Acrobat Reader software (versions 8.1 and
      later).</span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Meshes (obj) -
      Meshes are the result of the conversion of a point cloud into a triangulated mesh - with the
      texture (that is color imager) applied to the resulting triangulated facets. The mesh format is
      immediately usable by many software products including most animation and visualization
      software. Additionally the obj format can be viewed using a number of free 'viewers' that allow
      detailed manipulations, measurement and other operations. The Guides to Good Practice Laser
      Scanning Guide (<a
      href="http://guides.archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/g2gp/LaserScan_3-5">Section 3.5</a>)
      provides information on a number of these viewers.</span></li><li><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Point clouds - there are the digital data in a standard ASCII
      format where each point is represented by X,Y and Z and color readings. Most point cloud
      software can import this data
      format.</span></li></ol></blockquote><ul><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">There is detailed information on the procedures necessary to
      access and utilize these data in Limp et al (2011, see below) Section 10.2</span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;">This digital archive was undertaken in conjunction
      with an electronic publication through the Linking Electronic Archives and Publications II
      (<a href="http://intarch.ac.uk/leap/index.html">LEAP II</a>) project, funded by the
      <a href="http://www.mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>. The corresponding
      article is 'Developing a 3-D Digital Heritage Ecosystem: from object to representation and the
      role of a virtual museum in the 21st century' (2011) by Fred Limp, Angie Payne, Katie Simon,
      Snow Winters and Jack Cothren, which can be found in <a
