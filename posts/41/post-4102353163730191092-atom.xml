   <title type="text">Seshat: Global History Databank</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://seshatdatabank.info/">Seshat: Global History Databank</a><br /><blockquote><img alt="" class="main-nav-logo-img" height="48" src="http://seshatdatabank.info/wp-content/themes/seshat/img/logo.png" width="200" /></blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Seshat: Global History Databank is a large, international,  multidisciplinary team of evolutionary scientists, historians,  anthropologists, archaeologists, economists, and other social  scientists. Our team includes scholars from various backgrounds, policy  makers, and enthusiastic volunteers. Seshat is governed by an editorial  board, who oversee work done by postdoctoral researchers, collaborators  and consultants, and research assistants all over the world.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Our collective knowledge about past societies is almost entirely in a  form inaccessible to scientific analysis, stored in historians’ brains  or scattered over heterogeneous notes and publications. The huge  potential of this knowledge for testing theories about political and  economic development has been largely untapped. Seshat: Global History  Databank brings together the most current and comprehensive body of  knowledge about human history in one place.&nbsp;Our unique Databank  systematically collects what is currently known about the social&nbsp;and  political organization of human societies and how civilizations have  evolved over time.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">This massive collection of historical information allows us and  others to rigorously test different hypotheses about the rise and fall  of large-scale societies across the globe and human history. Working  with a large international and interdisciplinary team, our database  offers the means to study the past through well-established scientific  techniques.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">We believe that our approach is the best way to provide meaningful  answers to some of the most important questions about the human  experience – how and under what circumstances does prosocial behavior  evolve in large societies? What roles do religion and ritual activities  play in group cohesion and cultural development? What is the impact of  climatic and the environmental factors in societal advance? What  mechanisms translate economic growth into quality of life improvements  for the average person?</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">&nbsp;</blockquote>]]></content>
