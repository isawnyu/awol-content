    <title type="text">Non-Professional Archaeological Photographs-project</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.npaph.com/">Non-Professional Archaeological
      Photographs-project</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img

      class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The NPAPH-project has the aim to trace
      former students and volunteers who joined an excavation prior to the 1980s, to collect and
      digitise their photographic documentation, and, finally, to make it accessible to the public
      via digital archives. Furthermore, the project pleads for an international collaboration
      between archaeological institutions in order to connect these digital archives and bring them
      under the attention of the public by the use of this website.</span><br /><br
      /> <span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><strong>Context</strong></span><br /> <span
      style="font-size: x-small;">As the discipline of archaeology has developed significantly
      during the last six decades, it is inevitable that the views on how the progress and finds of
      an excavation should be recorded, have changed as well. All the developments that have
      influenced archaeological recording suggest that there may be a hiatus between what
      archaeologists actually recorded in the past and what we nowadays expect them to have
      documented at the time. It is the basic assumption of this project that the former
      'non-professionals' - participants of excavations who were not part of the trained staff, but
      who supported the dig as part of their continual education or out of interest, e.g. students
      and volunteers - may be the ones who are able to fill in the possible gap in the official
      documentation published by the academic staff, including in the area of archaeological
      photography.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The
      project will <em>in the first instance</em> focus on the period 1950-1980. This
      period is very interesting, because the lack of ubiquitous multimedia, poor photographic
      recording techniques and the high costs of the reproduction of photographs in those days
      generally restricted the amount of official documentation. By choosing the middle of the last
      century as starting-point, the presence of students and volunteers at an excavation is more
      likely and the chance that former non-professionals are still alive is fairly high, which would
      simplify the tracing considerable. The tracing will be possible, on the one hand, with the aid
      of registers that are kept in universities and archaeological institutions, containing personal
      details of former participants,&nbsp;and, on the other hand, with the aid of the internet
      and social media.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><strong>Join the NPAPH-project!</strong></span><br
      /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;"> Based on the reasons described at
      the section 'Principles', it will be useful for archaeological institutions to trace
      non-professional photographs of their excavations, to digitise and place them in an accessible
      digital archive for both scholars and the general public, and to participate in the
      NPAPH-project. It will be worth the effort! After all, ‘digging’ into the archaeological past
      in this way will not only be beneficial to present archaeological research, but it will also be
      an inspiring assignment for our students and volunteers of today, to assist in the process of
      tracing, collecting and digitising photographs.</span></blockquote><blockquote
