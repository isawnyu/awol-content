   <title type="text">The Prehistoric Stones of Greece: A Resource from Field Survey </title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/stones_ahrb_2013/">The Prehistoric Stones of Greece: A Resource from Field Survey   </a><br /><div id="archiveheader"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">   Paraskevi Elefanti, Gilbert Marshall, Clive Gamble, 2015&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><img alt="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/stones_ahrb_2013/images/cave.png" height="150" src="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/stones_ahrb_2013/images/cave.png" width="200" /> </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Prehistoric Stones of Greece set out to quantify and collate in  as much detail as possible, information about Palaeolithic and  Mesolithic sites in Greece, and to describe the field survey projects  which resulted in the discovery of the majority of these. Neolithic  sites discovered during field survey were also recorded. Material  culture including tools and other objects, structures and features,  along with fauna and flora were documented, including those from later  periods when from palimpsests or multi period sites. The aim was to  create an overview of the results of many years of intensive field  survey and to create a searchable archive with which to investigate  regional settlement patterns and to identify likely areas for future  research.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The dataset includes information about sites and findspots including  location, elevation, chronology, and the types of artefacts and ecofacts  recovered. These have been standardised as far as possible to allow  region wide comparisons and analysis of variability. The dataset is  predominantly based on published accounts and occasionally grey  literature from unpublished reports. In a small number of cases it has  benefited from the results of our own research in Greece.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">New field survey projects continue to be set up and sites and  findspots discovered, investigated and published. We endeavour to make  the dataset as up to date as possible and continue to refine the records  and to add new information as it becomes available.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">                                                        <br /><ul class="dlMenu"><li> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/stones_ahrb_2013/index.cfm">Introduction</a></span></li><li> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/stones_ahrb_2013/overview.cfm">Overview</a></span></li><li>  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/stones_ahrb_2013/query.cfm">Site Search</a></span> </li><li>  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/stones_ahrb_2013/query_survey.cfm">Survey Search</a></span> </li><li> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/stones_ahrb_2013/metadata.cfm">Metadata</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/stones_ahrb_2013/stats.cfm">Usage Statistics</a></span></li></ul></blockquote><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div>]]></content>
