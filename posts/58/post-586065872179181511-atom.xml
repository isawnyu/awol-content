   <title type="text">The CSA Propylaea Project</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp;[First posted in AWOL 9 October 2009, updated 13 July 2015]</span><br /><br /><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/">The CSA Propylaea Project</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/images/Pcard_small.png" height="128" src="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/images/Pcard_small.png" width="200" /> </blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>Welcome to the Introduction of the Final Report of the <a href="http://csanet.org/" title="Center for the Study of Architecture Home Page">CSA</a> Propylaea Project.</b> The project, which began as an idea in 1999, was intended to create a  unified digital (i.e., computer-based) resource concerning the  Propylaea. This <i><b>Final Report,</b></i> which consists  of many web documents as well as digital files available for download,  includes all materials created in the course of the project â€” and all  supporting materials. Thus, these materials serve as the project's final  publication. It should be noted that these documents have not been  subjected to peer review. </span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Propylaea is the magnificent entrance structure that has guarded  the entrance to the Acropolis in Athens since shortly after the middle  of the fifth century B.C.E. Designed by the architect Mnesicles, the  Propylaea stands today as a glorious testimony to the creativity of the  architect and to the soaring power and majesty of the ancient Greek  architectural vocabulary when put to use by a master such as Mnesicles. </span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>The central aim of the project was to create a single, integrated, digital resource for any student of the Propylaea.</b> This digital resource was to include both textual and photographic  material (some already extant), and it was to include a stone-by-stone  CAD model of the building itself. Being digital, this material was to be  made available via the propylaea.org website; it was assumed that the  project website would ultimately cease to function and that the material  would be placed in a digital archives. Thus, the material is now  available via the Archaeology Data Service, not the website of the CSA  Propylaea Project, which will exist for some time merely to point  readers to the relevant ADS pages. Some of that material is available  here. Other parts were not completed before the project was terminated  near the end of 2008. For scholars and others who wish to examine the  project in detail, the recommended starting page is the <a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/ScholarIndex.cfm" title="Scholars' Introduction">Project Introduction</a>; for those who have a more general interest in this topic, the better starting point is the <a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/indexns.cfm" title="General Introduction">Project Background and Rationale.</a> </span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">Please note that there are no Greek translations of this or other  pages describing the work of the project. Greek translations had been  posted previously on the project website. It became apparent that the  difficulties of maintaining up-to-date translations made it preferable  to omit translations of any kind. Furthermore, online translation  facilities, while not yet adequate for anything so complex as this  material, will become more and more useful and will soon take the place  of supplied translations, providing virtually any language for any  reader. It is important to realize, however, that automated translations  remain inadequate at this time (2013); readers should be wary of  relying upon any such translation and should be sure to use the posted,  English version of any web page for quotation or other citation.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="float: left;"><ul><li><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/indexns.cfm">General introduction</a></li><li><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/ScholarIndex.cfm">Scholars' introduction.</a></li><li><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/PropHist.cfm">Project history</a></li><li><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/pubs.cfm">Publications</a></li><li><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/propgeninfo.cfm">General information about the Propylaea</a></li><li><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/downloads.cfm?group=28">Photographs of the Propylaea</a></li><li><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/PhotoDatabase.cfm">Photography database</a></li><li><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/photothoughts.cfm">Photograph discussion</a></li><li><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/coordsystems.cfm">Coordinate systems</a></li><li><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/mechdraw.cfm">Mechanical drafting conventions</a></li><li><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/Surveymethods.cfm">Survey methods</a></li><li><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/notebooks.cfm">Survey notebooks</a></li><li><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/propylaea_kress_2013/databasedoc.cfm">Survey database</a> </li></ul></div></blockquote>]]></content>
