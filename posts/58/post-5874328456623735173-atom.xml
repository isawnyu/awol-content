      <blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">One goal of the <a
      href="http://sites.tufts.edu/perseids" title="Perseids Project">Perseids Project</a>
      is to engage humanities students in research and enable them to contribute to the open access
      resources on which the Perseus Digital Library is built. Tufts students in Professor
      Marie-Claire Beaulieuâ€™s Fall 2013 Greek Mythology class completed commentaries on myths in
      selected texts and artifacts through the Perseids platform. The student commentaries were
      reviewed by graduate teaching assistants Julia Lenzi and Timothy Buckingham, who worked with
      the students to revise their work when necessary. Those commentaries that were accepted for
      publication are now available as reading aids on the Perseus platform, via the new annotations
      widget. This widget appears on the right side of the text display for only those passages of
      text on which commentaries are available. The <a
      href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0013.tlg007.perseus-eng1"
      title="Hymn 7 to Dionysus">Homeric Hymn 7 to Dionysus</a> is an example of a text
      which has several commentaries available for it. For artifacts with commentaries, the
      annotations widget appears on the left side of the screen above the artifact metadata. An
      example artifact is the vase <a
      href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Munich+3297&amp;object=vase"
      title="Munich 3297">Munich 8297</a>.</span><br /><br /> <span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Going forward we expect to continue to expand upon to the number
      and variety of annotations available for the Perseus
      resources.</span></blockquote></div>]]></content>
