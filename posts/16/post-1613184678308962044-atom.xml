   <title type="text">Israel Antiquities Authority Scientific Archive 1919-1948</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp;[First posted in AWOL 16 January 2013, updated 27 October 2015]</span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.iaa-archives.org.il/">Israel Antiquities Authority Scientific Archive 1919-1948</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://www.iaa-archives.org.il/images/page-title.png" class="decoded" src="http://www.iaa-archives.org.il/images/page-title.png" height="62" width="320" /></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit; font-size: x-small;">About the Archives&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit; font-size: x-small;">The archive of the <a href="http://www.antiquities.org.il/">Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA)</a> is located in Jerusalem. It essentially continues the archive from the  British Mandate era. Following the conquest of Palestine by British  forces, headed by General Allenby in 1918, the documentation and data  collecting of ancient and archaeological sites had begun. Once a civil  government was established by the British Mandatory Authorities in 1920,  the Department of Antiquities was created and the archive had become an  integral part of it.<br /> <br />The Department of Antiquities of the State of Israel was founded on July  26, 1948, Its activities were based on British Mandate Antiquities  ordinances. In 1978, the Mandate ordinances were superseded by the Law  of Antiquities that was passed by the Knesset. In 1990, the <a href="http://www.antiquities.org.il/">Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA)</a> was established and replaced the Department of Antiquities.&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit; font-size: x-small;">About the Project&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit; font-size: x-small;">   The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) archive entered the government  project of “intensifying national foundations and heritage”, with the  aim of preserving and digitizing the British Mandatory section.&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit; font-size: x-small;">The purpose of the project is to enable the wide public in Israel and across the world accessing this unique data.&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit; font-size: x-small;">The digitations project includes, first and foremost, the physical  preservation of the different files, which include hand and typewritten  texts, photographs, maps and plans that appear on a variety of papers,  including greaseproof, rice, stencils and others.<br />The process of digitations is done to preserve the original data for  generations to come. The process prevents the physical deterioration of  the material and its wear out, caused by the touch of human hands and  the climatic changes. The process consists of digitizing the data and  indexing it.<br /><br />  At this first stage, the digital archive includes the scientific  Mandatory archive in English; accordingly, the site was developed in  English, with a general explanation in Hebrew.</span></blockquote>]]></content>
