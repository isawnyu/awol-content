   <title type="text">Early Christian Writings</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://earlychristianwritings.com/intro.html">Early Christian Writings</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The purpose of this web site is to set out all of the Christian writings  that are believed to have been written in the first and second  centuries, as well as a few selected from the early third.  I have also  included non-Christian documents that may have special bearing on the  study of early Christianity in order to make this web site a  comprehensive sourcebook.  I have provided links to English translations  for all of these documents.  When available, the work has also been  provided in the original language, usually Greek.  I have also provided  information and scholarly opinion regarding the background, authorship,  dating, and provenance of these documents.  These comments are intended  to provide an introduction.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">I did not want to follow the common scheme of organizing early Christian  documents into the canon and apocrypha, which is simply anachronistic.   Because it is the most intuitive and useful, I have ordered them based  on one possible chronological scheme.  My judgments concerning the  authenticity and dating of the documents concerned are made in the best  tradition of biblical scholarship.  Nevertheless, the ordering is almost  certainly wrong in some part.  To provide some bearings, a range of  probable dating is provided for the scheme, but this range of dating can  be disputed.  All dates are approximate.  An alphabetical listing is  also provided as an easier way to find a specific text.&nbsp;</span><br /><br />   <br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://earlychristianwritings.com/newtestament.html">New Testament</a></span>	 <br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://earlychristianwritings.com/apocrypha.html">Apocrypha</a></span>   <br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://earlychristianwritings.com/gnostics.html">Gnostics</a></span>   <br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://earlychristianwritings.com/churchfathers.html">Church Fathers</a></span>   <br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://earlychristianwritings.com/other.html">Other</a></span> </blockquote>]]></content>
