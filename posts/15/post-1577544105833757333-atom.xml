    <title type="text">News from CDLI: Digital capture of the Harvard cuneiform collection</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Digital capture of the Harvard cuneiform collection<br
      /><blockquote><span style="font-family: 'PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif';
      font-size: x-small;"><span><div>We are very pleased to announce completion of an
      initial stage of collaboration between the <a
      href="http://www.semiticmuseum.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do">Semitic Museum (SM)</a>,
      Harvard University, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation-supported research project "<a
      href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2010/03/announcement-on-funded-digitisation-of.html">Creating
      a Sustainable Digital Cuneiform Library</a>" (CSDCL). Under the general direction of the
      <a href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/"> Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative</a> (CDLI -
      Los Angeles/Berlin), CSDCL has over the past two years been involved in the digital capture,
      persistent archiving and free Internet dissemination of
      significant&nbsp;cuneiform&nbsp;collections world-wide.&nbsp;The over 4600
      cuneiform artifacts of the Semitic Museum represent a very significant archive of texts in a
      major American collection--indeed, after the collections of Yale, the University of
      Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago, this is the fourth largest collection in the US,
      with, among other inscriptions of historical interest, a uniquely important group of legal
      texts from the middle of the 2nd millennium BC; a set of widely cited administrative documents
      from the 24th and 21st centuries BC; and a still largely unpublished archive from the period of
      Persian rule over Babylonia.&nbsp;In furtherance of a collaboration between members of the
      CDLI and Harvard academic staff, notably Benjamin Studevent-Hickman, and with the kind approval
      of Piotr Steinkeller and the assistance of James Armstrong, Lance Allred was able to commence
      scanning of the collection in May of 2009, and has since made several trips to Cambridge to
      continue his work. Following cataloguing, and fatcross-processing and cleaning of raw files in
      Los Angeles, initial images were posted to the CDLI website in July of the same year. While
      much of Dr. Allred's early work was dedicated to the capture of the important Nuzi collection
      of the SM, subsequent scanning sessions have begun with the systematic digitization of all
      texts without regard to their state of publication; these can now be viewed at <a
      href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/collections/harvard/harvard.html"
      target="1">http://cdli.ucla.edu/collections/harvard/harvard.html</a> or by <a
      href="http://www.cdli.ucla.edu/cdlisearch/search/">searching the CDLI
      database</a>.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Since September of
      2009, this cooperation has been under the direct supervision of James Armstrong's successor,
      Dr. Adam Aja; with Dr. Aja's close collaboration, we have been able to reformat to CDLI
      standards the Museum's full cuneiform collection catalogue, and he has facilitated the creation
      and signing, by legal representatives of the President and Fellows of Harvard University and
      the Regents of the University of California, of an agreement of cooperation between the SM and
      the CDLI that went into effect on 23 April of
      2010.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>From the beginning, SM
      viewed this effort as an opportunity to make available its cuneiform collection to the
      world-wide community of web researchers and informal learners. The agreement between Harvard
      and UCLA that lays out the SM/CDLI collaboration is designed to assist cuneiform specialists in
      the collation of existing publications, while at the same time providing general access to
      tablet images in conjunction with collated transliterations to lay the broadest possible
      foundation for integrative research by the scholarly community. We are confident that our
      adherence in this collaboration to the principles of free and open access best serves all in
      the Humanities, but particularly in the fields of dead language research that are dependent on
      the availability of primary source materials for their work. In opening to world-wide
      inspection cuneiform collections such as that located at Harvard, we believe, further, that
      humanists fulfill their curatorial responsibilities to permanently archive, and to make
      available to the public all such artifacts of shared world cultural heritage that are in their
      immediate or indirect care.</div></span></span><span style="font-size:
