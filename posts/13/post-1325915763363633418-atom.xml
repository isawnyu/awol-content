    <title type="text">Ancient Arabia: Languages and Cultures</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/">Ancient Arabia: Languages
      and Cultures</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">The Arabian Peninsula lies at the heart of the Middle East and in antiquity it
      stood between the mighty civilizations of Egypt and Mesapotamia. Yet, our ignorance until now
      of the history of Arabia before the emergence of Islam in the 7th century BC, has left a huge
      blank at the centre of what we know of the ancient Near East. This blank is now gradually being
      filled in, bringing to light not only previously little known - or even unknown - cultures
      spread over a vast region, but also a more complete picture of the ancient Near East as a
      whole.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Geographically "Ancient Arabia" refers to the Arabian Peninsula with, to the
      north, the Syro-Arabian desert stretching into what is modern Syria and Jordan.
      Chronologically, it covers all periods from the first evidence of human activity in the
      Peninsula, some 400,000 years ago, to the emergence of Islam...</span><br /><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The AALC project is creating the OCIANA, which
      will bring together in one corpus the almost 39,000 Ancient North Arabian inscriptions known to
      date. The initial phase of this project has been completed and at present the OCIANA contains
      3420 previously unpublished Safaitic inscriptions recorded by the late Geraldine King in 1989
      on the <a
      href="http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/projects/safaitic-database-online">Basalt
      Desert Rescue Survey</a>. The AALC project has also put online a downloadable pdf of
      Geraldine King's fundamental study of the inscriptions in a dialect and script used mainly by
      nomads in the Ḥismā sand desert of southern Jordan and northern Saudi Arabia, and which are
      therefore called "Hismaic" (formerly "<a
      href="http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/component/content/article/24" rel="shadowbox"
      style="color: #003366;">Thamudic E</a>").</span><br /><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">In addition, the site is making available some 800 texts
      recorded in the mountainous region of Dhofar, in the south of modern Oman by the <a
      href="http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/projects/dhofar-epigraphic-project"
      target="_self">Dhofar Epigraphic Project</a>. They were painted on cave walls and
      inscribed on stones in a script that as yet remains undeciphered and in a language that is
      still unknown. A concordance of the inscriptions has been provided which it is hoped will aid
      their eventual decipherment.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">The OCIANA will be continuously updated as more inscriptions are discovered.
      Similarly, as more rock-art, and historical, archaeological, and linguistic material from
      ancient Arabia becomes available it is planned to make it accessible either on the AALC site or
      via links to other sites.</span><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><span><span>The AALC project also is also making available other
      primary sources for ancient Arabia such as </span><a
      href="http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/projects/wj-bankes-journey-to-petra-1818"
      target="_self">Norman Lewis's</a><span>&nbsp;previously unpublished
      transcription of W.J. Bankes's journal of his visit to Petra in 1818, as well as links to
      websites, further reading and bibliography for the study of ancient Arabia, and biographical
      notes on some of the scholars who have contributed most to this website and its associated
      projects, and to the study of ancient Arabia.</span></span></span><br
      /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The
      AALC Projects<br /></span> <br /><span style="font-size:

      margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 20px;" width="136" />The languages and cultures of ancient
      Arabia have long been studied in the University of Oxford, a legacy of the pioneering work
      undertaken by the late <a href="http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/projects/11"
      target="_self">Professor A.F.L. Beeston</a>. The primary aim of the project Ancient
      Arabia : Languages and Cultures (AALC) is to make accessible through a single central portal a
      variety of resources for the study of ancient Arabia, thereby creating a global resource for
      the study of the languages and cultures of ancient Arabia and the Arabs before the emergence of
      Islam.</span><br /><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The Academic Director
      of AALC is <a href="http://www.orinst.ox.ac.uk/staff/iw/mmacdonald.html"
      target="_self">Michael Macdonald</a>, an expert in the languages and cultures of
      Ancient Arabia. AALC was initiated and is managed by <a href="http://www.krc.ox.ac.uk/"
      target="_blank">The Khalili Research Centre</a> (KRC) of the <a
      href="http://www.orinst.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Faculty of Oriental Studies</a> in
      the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Oxford</a>, and
      the Director of the KRC, <a
      href="http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/krc/index.php/staff/13-professor-jeremy-johns"
      target="_blank">Jeremy Johns</a>, is the Administrative Director of AALC. The
      technical aspects of the project, including this website, are managed by Daniel Burt, and the
      scanning and cataloguing is the work of Jennifer Lockie.</span><br /><br
      /><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The AALC is managed by a small committee
      consisting of the team members already mentioned, reinforced by <a
      href="http://www.orinst.ox.ac.uk/staff/iw/rhoyland.html" target="_blank">Professor Robert
      Hoyland</a>.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:
      xx-small;">In October 2011, AALC received an initial grant from the University of Oxford's
      John Fell Fund. Further applications to continue the work of AALC and its associated projects
      are pending and in preparation.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:
      xx-small;">Much of the focus of the initial year (2010–2011) of the AALC project is to
      digitise and publish the work undertaken by the late <a
      href="http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/projects/10" target="_self">Dr Geraldine
      King</a>, including her previously unpublished doctoral thesis on <a
      href="http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/projects/early-north-arabian-hismaic"
      target="_self">Early North Arabian Thamudic E [Hismaic]</a>, and the large amounts of
      epigraphic material that she recorded and had prepared for publication before her early death
      (including the <a
      href="http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/projects/black-desert-rescue-survey">Basalt
      Desert Rescue Survey</a> and the <a
      href="http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/projects/dhofar-epigraphic-project">Dhofar
      Epigraphic Project</a>).</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:
      xx-small;">In addition to the work undertaken by Geraldine King, the site will also contain
      work undertaken by Michael Macdonald and his collaborators, including the massive <a
      href="http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/projects/safaitic-database-online"
      target="_self">Safaitic Database Online</a>, alongside other primary sources for the
      study of ancient Arabia, such as <a
