Under this  classicist premise, he mentioned and described many things worth seeing  (theoremata), not least being works of art, together with oral and  literary narratives (logoi) associated with them which were collected by  Pausanias in the cities and sanctuaries of Greece during the Roman era.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />The purpose of the database “Images in Pausanias” is to register  systematically all figurative works of art found in Pausanias and make  them accessible for combined online research. Bibliographical notes are  provided in order to facilitate access to the respective scholarship.  Regarding bibliography, Book X is still a work in progress, due to the  fact that the volume in question of the commented edition “Pausania,  Guida della Grecia” has not yet appeared (August 2014), the latter being  an important source for the database.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">For  original Greek works of art that have survived and have been plausibly  identified, links are given to the meta-database “Arachne” (in  progress). Roman works of art, which are considered by modern  scholarship to be copies of Greek originals mentioned in Pausanias, have  not been taken into consideration because of the hypothetical nature of  the majority of these attributions and without a clear borderline  between plausible and improbable identifications being present.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />The content of the database for every work of art provides the text  passage of Pausanias in question, together with a German translation of  the text (E. Meyer, in some cases modified). Moreover, it contains  information in the following categories: place and context of original  setting (e.g. sanctuary, public space), function (e.g. cult statue,  commemorative monument, honorary statue), genre (e.g. sculpture in the  round, relief), theme, artist, commissioner, material, and date. A  combined search is possible via the extended search function of  “Arachne".</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />This project was realized under the direction of Tonio Hölscher at the  Institute of Classical Archaeology of the University of Heidelberg. The  task of compiling and processing the data was in the hands of Katharina  Bolle, Gunnar Dumke, Johannes Fouquet, Werner Schneider and Nicolas  Zenzen. All work in Heidelberg was financed by the Institute of  Classical Archaeology and from funds of the Manfred Lautenschläger  Research prize awarded to Tonio Hölscher.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The implementation of the database “Images in Pausanias” into the  meta-database “Arachne” was initiated and supervised by Reinhard  Förtsch. The data import was prepared and coordinated by Marcel Riedel.  Benjamin Gelhaar and David Neugebauer executed the implementation.  The  present page was developed by Karen Schwane. To all sponsors and  promoters as well as to all collaborators and contributors we express  our warmest thanks.</span><br /></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="einsprung"> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/arachne3/arachne/index.php?view%5Blayout%5D=search_result_overview&amp;view%5Bcategory%5D=overview&amp;search%5Bconstraints%5D%5Bobjekt%5D%5BArbeitsnotiz%5D=bildwerke-pausanias">Go to the individual objects</a></span></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">  </span><div class="einsprung"> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/arachne3/arachne/index.php?view%5Blayout%5D=search_result_overview&amp;view%5Bcategory%5D=overview&amp;search%5Bconstraints%5D%5Bgruppen%5D%5BArbeitsnotizGruppen%5D=bildwerke-pausanias">Go to the multipart monuments (groups)</a></span></div></blockquote>]]></content>
