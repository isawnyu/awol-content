      />&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">For over a thousand years the Byzantine Emperor sat in his palace, ruling over the
      empire as God’s regent on earth. His was the ultimate authority. The emperor was the font of
      all law, granter of titles and offices, distributer of largess, master of the Church, commander
      of the army, head of the bureaucracy, and supreme judge. The decisions of the individual who
      sat on the throne had repercussions throughout the Byzantine world and far beyond. Decrees,
      letters, judgments, and commands left Constantinople every day signed by the emperor in red ink
      and secured with the imperial seal. These seals not only protected and authenticated imperial
      documents, they also spread the emperor’s image and served as imperial propaganda. It is no
      accident that while one emperor chose to be depicted as a soldier, another chose to be shown as
      a civilian. Although Christ accompanies one emperor, another might choose St. Constantine, or
      the Mother of God, or perhaps simply the cross. Was his title Greek,
      <i>basileus,</i> or Latin, <i>augustus</i>? Did he want to emphasise
      his family as an imperial asset or assert his position as <i>autokrator</i>, the
      sole ruler of God’s empire on earth? The designs of the imperial seals are interesting for more
      than their artistic value, they provide an insight into the minds and policies of the rulers
      whose image they bore; they tell us not only how they wished to be viewed by the recipients of
      their letters, but also how they viewed themselves. Imperial seals, with their titles, images,
      and projection of divinely sanctioned authority, show the blend of Roman, Hellenistic, and
      Judaeo-Christian ingredients that went into the Byzantine imperial recipe.</span><br
      /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">This exhibition presents the imperial
      lead seals from the Dumbarton Oaks Collection. Sections include: a chronology of the rulers of
      Byzantium exploring the design and inscriptions of their seals and presenting brief
      biographies; an analysis of the development of imperial titulature; the iconographic choices
      made by usurpers; and finally a section on seals that show or reference the imperial family. We
      hope that after visiting this exhibit you will be inspired to explore the online catalogue of
      Byzantine seals in the Dumbarton Oaks collection. This project was begun in 2010, and is
      continually updated as more seals from our collection of 17,000 are
      catalogued.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">&nbsp; <span
