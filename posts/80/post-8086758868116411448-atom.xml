      style="font-weight: normal;">Pelagios Chapter 3: Early Geospatial
      Documents</span></a><br />Monday, 16 September 2013&nbsp;<span
      style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><br /><blockquote
      class="tr_bq"><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: x-small;">A few
      weeks ago we trailed that we had some exciting news and now we can finally announce it. Thanks
      to the generosity of <a href="http://www.mellon.org/">The Andrew W. Mellon
      Foundation</a>, Pelagios is entering a third, even more ambitious phase. We will be
      extending the Pelagios approach to all early geospatial documents up to 1492 (a game-changing
      year for the history of cartography). This means that we'll be dealing with texts and maps, not
      only from the ancient Greco-Roman worlds, but also the early Byzantine, Christian, Maritime,
      Islamic and Chinese traditions.</span><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align:
      center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a
      href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/World_map_pietro_vesconte.jpg"
      style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="319"
      src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/World_map_pietro_vesconte.jpg"
      width="320" /></a></span></div><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">With a digital place index of maps and descriptions of the world in place,
      researchers and the general public will be able to explore online the historical significance
      of both famous and obscure places in the history of geography. As just one example, <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_%28Ptolemy%29">Claudius Ptolemy</a> used
      London as one of his primary reference points for global time zones in the late second century,
      just as we do today. While such coincidences may be rare, and many places in early maps and
      texts are unidentified, or existed only in the popular or religious imaginations, our aim is to
      help their rich biographies to be told. With such an unprecedented variety of data linked
      together, it will be possible to trace in broad terms the continuities - and discontinuities -
      of people's responses to the world around them. Equally exciting, and thanks to the continuing
      annotation of data by Pelagios growing community of partners, you'll also be able to bring
      together disparate fragments of its life history, its connections with other places, its
      stories and imagery.</span></div><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br
      /></span><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The
      project raises significant technological challenges as well. First of all we will need to make
      sure that URI-based gazetteers (standardised lists of places) are available for all of our
      periods and regions, and aligned with one another so that they can be cross-referenced. This
      means working not only with our old friends at <a
      href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/">Pleiades</a>, but also with new ones at the <a
      href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/%7Echgis/">China Historical GIS</a> and <a
      href="http://www.pastplace.org/">PastPlace</a>. Then we will need to use a raft of
      methods, old and new, to identify toponyms in texts and images, and in a range of languages.
      Optical Character Recognition (OCR) – a computer-based method for the automatic recognition of
      text in digitized images – is inadequate for use with medieval handwritten script. Therefore we
      are developing <a href="http://rsimon.github.com/toponym_identification">new,
      semi-automatic methods</a>, which employ image processing and statistical approaches to
      eliminate as much of the tedious manual work of transcription as possible. Third, we will need
      to relate those place references to the gazetteers, building on the knowledge and expertise of
      a network of experts, along with a few tricks of our own. Places that we can't identify we
      intend to throw out to the public, along with any clues we have available, to invite the wider
      community to have a go. Finally, we continue to work on the <a
      href="http://pelagios.dme.ait.ac.at/api">Pelagios search API</a> and web interface so
      that the results will become ever easier to work with and incorporate in other digital
      resources online.</span><br /></div><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">In addition to the continually growing community of projects providing content
      about all these places, we will be working in collaboration with specialists from all around
      the world, including from the British Library, Queen Mary, University of London, KCL, the
      University of Portsmouth, the University of Edinburgh, the Orient Institute of Beirut, the
      Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, Drew University and Harvard University. If you
      would like to get involved in any way, please do contact
      us!</span></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">And see AWOL's <a
