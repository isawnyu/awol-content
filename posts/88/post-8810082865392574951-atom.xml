      style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Dear Library and Publisher
      Colleagues,</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br
      /></div><div style="text-align: left;"> </div><div style="text-align:
      left;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">I am writing to share exciting
      news:&nbsp; today, we are making journal content on JSTOR published prior to 1923 in the
      United States and prior to 1870 elsewhere, freely available to the public for reading and
      downloading. This includes nearly 500,000 articles from more than 200 journals, representing
      approximately 6% of the total content on JSTOR.&nbsp;</span></div><div
      style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">
      </div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">We are
      taking this step as part of our continuous effort to provide the widest possible access to the
      content on JSTOR while ensuring the long-term preservation of this important
      material.&nbsp; To date, we have primarily provided access to people through a growing base
      of libraries and institutions. In 1995, only ten journals were digitized and available to just
      a few universities.&nbsp; Today, millions of people from more than 7,000 institutions in
      153 countries have access to journals on JSTOR through their universities, colleges, high
      schools, businesses, research institutions, museums, historical societies, and public
      libraries.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br
      /></div><div style="text-align: left;"> </div><div style="text-align:
      left;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">This constitutes remarkable progress and
      impact, but there remain many people who are not affiliated with institutions who want access
      to the knowledge preserved in JSTOR. We have taken a variety of steps over the years to serve
      them. First, in 1999 we began partnering with our publishers and scholarly societies to provide
      access to their journals to their society members and other individuals through what we call
      our Individual Access Program. More than 300 journals are accessible to individuals in this way
      today.&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, in 2006 we initiated another program–the Publisher Sales
      Service–to enable publishers to sell their articles to the public through the JSTOR platform.
      There are 762 journals that have articles for sale in this way today, with prices set by each
      individual publisher. Third, in 2009 we began partnering with universities and colleges to
      offer their alumni access to content on JSTOR. There are 18 schools in this pilot program
      today.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br
      /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">While these efforts are serving some users, there is more that can be done. About
      a year ago, we started working on a next set of initiatives to test and provide additional
      forms of access to content on JSTOR for individuals. These initiatives include: supporting
      publishers who wish to test different price points for their articles that are part of the
      Publisher Sales Service; working with our publishers to experiment with a new capability for
      individuals to read some articles online without charge if they register with us; and providing
      free access for individuals to the early journal content available through JSTOR. We are very
      excited about the potential for this next wave of efforts. We are confident that they will
      result in broader access to scholarship in the near term, and enable JSTOR and our publishers
      to test and develop new models that meet the wider public’s needs in the future.</span>
      </div></blockquote><blockquote><div style="text-align: left;"><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">I hope you share our excitement about today’s announcement. We
      look forward to continuing to work with you to further access to individuals in the future.

      style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">
      </div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">On a
      final note, I realize that some people may speculate that making the Early Journal Content free
      to the public today is a direct response to widely-publicized events over the summer involving
      an individual who was indicted for downloading a substantial portion of content from JSTOR,
      allegedly for the purpose of posting it to file sharing sites. While we had been working on
      releasing the pre-1923/pre-1870 content before the incident took place, it would be inaccurate
      to say that these events have had no impact on our planning. We considered whether to delay or
      accelerate this action, largely out of concern that people might draw incorrect conclusions
      about our motivations. In the end, we decided to press ahead with our plans to make the Early
      Journal Content available, which we believe is in the best interest of our library and
      publisher partners, and students, scholars, and researchers
      everywhere.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br
