      will also assure its continuing development and its accessibility to researchers around the

      2008. Thereafter, GRI continued producing records under the new name of IBA before budgetary
      constraints led to the difficult decision to discontinue its support earlier this year. At this
      time, GRI made IBA (as well as the historical data in BHA and RILA) freely available on its
      website, so the historical data would continue to aid researchers. Thomas Gaehtgens, GRI
      director, confirms that “we will continue to make the historical BHA and RILA data available on
      the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/bha/" target="_blank">
      website</a> free of charge to researchers who access it.”</span><br

      <br />Following <a
      href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2010/03/bad-news-bibliography-of-history-of-art.html">announcements
      to subscribers</a> that the Bibliography of the History of Art (BHA) had been
      discontinued, the Getty Research Institute announced today <span
      style="font-size:100%;">[April 1, 2010]</span>:<br /><a
      href="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/bha/"><br />THE GETTY PROVIDES
      FREE ACCESS TO THE BHA ON ITS WEB SITE</a><blockquote><span
      style="font-size:85%;">As of April 1, 2010, the Bibliography of the History of Art (BHA)
      will be available free of charge on the Getty Web site at <a
      href="http://library.getty.edu/bha">http://library.getty.edu/bha</a>. Free Web access
      to BHA is an advantage not only to all traditional users of the database but also to such
      potential users as institutions in developing countries and independent scholars worldwide, who
      until now have been unable to afford access to the BHA. Since ending its collaboration with the
      Institut de l'Information Scientifique et Technique (INIST)–CNRS in December 2007, the Getty
      has been searching for partners to continue the production and distribution of BHA. This
      process has been complicated, and with no suitable arrangement immediately available, the Getty
      decided to act on its commitment to the scholarly community by providing access to BHA directly
      from its own Web site.<br /><br />BHA on the Getty Web site offers both basic and
      advanced search modules, and can be searched easily by subject, artist, author, article or
      journal title, and other elements. To search BHA, please visit, <a
      href="http://library.getty.edu/bha">http://library.getty.edu/bha</a>. Note that the
      database search includes both BHA (covering 1990-2007) and the <em>International
      Bibliography of Art</em> (IBA), covering the years 2008 and part of 2009. The
      <em>Répertoire de la litterature de l'art</em> (RILA), one of the predecessors of
      BHA, with records that cover 1975–1989, will be online by May 1.<br
