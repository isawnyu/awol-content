      style="font-size: x-small;"></span></blockquote><blockquote><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">The idea for the proposal of this assignment was triggered by
      the corresponding project undertaken by the Greek and Roman Department of the British Museum,
      which consisted partly of the digitization of the material excavated by the British at Enkomi
      as part of the Turner Bequest excavations from 1894 to 1896. The Cyprus Museum objects from
      these excavations and the digitization of this material will provide a link and ultimately
      unite the two databases, thus reconstituting, to the extent possible, the contents of the
      tombs.</span> </blockquote><blockquote><div></div><span
      style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> The
      proposal was submitted and approved by the Promotion Foundation for Research in 2008. Its
      duration of 24 months (from January 2009 to December 2010) involved archival research
      concerning the excavations of one hundred tombs of the Late Bronze Age, of considerable wealth,
      excavated in 1896 and published in 1900. Two thirds of the objects were transferred to the
      British Museum as per the terms of the Antiquities Law at the time which allowed the excavator,
      the owner of the land and the Government a share of one third each of the total number of
      objects found.&nbsp; The excavators usually bought the land and were, therefore, granted
      two thirds of the finds. The Cyprus Museum share was kept in the old premises at Victoria
      Street. It was then transferred to the new Cyprus Museum, around 1909 and was given new
      accessory numbers.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">
      </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> The programme is a collaborative effort
      between the Department of Antiquities, the Open University of Cyprus and the British Museum.
      Its implementation will ensure the preservation of the collection, it will provide
      accessibility to objects belonging to the so-called “old collection” in the Cyprus Museum store
      rooms and consequently facilitate research. Furthermore, it will promote the use and
      application of statistical and analytical techniques for archaeological data and will give the
      opportunity to educational institutions to use it as a teaching aid.</span><br
      /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><br
      /><div><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Having in mind that Enkomi is located
      in the occupied part of Cyprus and that the material of the excavations from the site,
      initiated at the end of the 19th century, is dispersed in different museums of the world, the
      digitisation of its material is of primary importance. The project may act as a precedent in
      bringing together dispersed material from the same sites, located in different museums and
      obstructing a holistic view of those sites. It constitutes the first organised attempt to
      create a database of antiquities kept in the Cyprus Museum, and the first attempt to transmit
      data and information through the internet, and via a collaboration between major
      institutions.</span></div><ul class="menu"><li class="leaf first
