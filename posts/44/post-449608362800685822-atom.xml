    <title type="text">Irisagrig in CDLI</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://tinyurl.com/k3gxgcn">Irisagrig in CDLI</a> (via
      email)<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Those
      interested in recently uncovered archives of Ur III settlements may want to have a scroll
      through the provisional Irisagrig text transliterations and images recently released in CDLI.
      All entries suspected of deriving from this city are at &lt;<a
      href="http://tinyurl.com/k3gxgcn">http://tinyurl.com/k3gxgcn</a>&gt;, of course
      the main component being those texts published by David Owen in Nisaba 15, but including as
      well the archives known among specialists as SI.A-a (Calvot, MVN 8, nos. 151ff; Sigirst, Owen
      &amp; Young, MVN 13, nos.&nbsp; 41ff., 884ff.; Garfinkle, ZA 93, 170ff.; etc.) and
      Turam-ili (van de Mieroop, JCS 38, 25ff.; Garfinkle, JCS 54, 32ff.; etc.) that share many of
      the same month names (&lt;<a
      href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/tools/ur3months/irisagrig.html">http://cdli.ucla.edu/tools/ur3months/irisagrig.html</a>&gt;).
      The total of these entries is currently 1514 (of which SI.A-a, Turam-ili and many others are of
      uncertain provenience, 500 in all), but including 230 composite seals (&lt;<a
      href="http://tinyurl.com/kcqd649">http://tinyurl.com/kcqd649</a>&gt;), thus fewer
      than 1300 tablets. 230 potential individual seal holders is certainly no small number for the
      administration of an until recently relatively unknown settlement, and should serve as a
      warning that many more Irisagrig tablets are yet to be encountered.<br /><br
      />CDLI’s Irisagrig files have profited, first and foremost, from the untiring work of David
      Owen in the course of a phenomenal harvest of texts from online auction sites, and from his
      expansive network of associations with colleagues and collections managers—David forwarded to
      me his Nisaba 15 transliterations before and after their paper publication, and he and I have
      for years been exchanging URLs of online artifact documentation that emerges for a short while
      in the Web, and then sinks again into darkness—; from the generous collaboration of Tohru
      Ozaki, who contributed his collations and corrections of many of the Nisaba 15 entries, some
      going back to work done together with Marcel Sigrist (thus, many Nisaba 15 version histories in
      CDLI pages are capped by those designated as "credit ozaki"); and of Bertrand Lafont, whose
      work with David on the Lebanese Adra collection has materially improved the images of the
      Irisagrig corpus in CDLI.<br /><br />We welcome further corrections and additions
      to this new data set.<br /><br />Bob Englund<br
