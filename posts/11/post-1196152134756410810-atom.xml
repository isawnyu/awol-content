   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://projectmosul.itn-dch.net/">Project Mosul</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><h1><span style="font-size: x-small;">About Project Mosul</span></h1><span style="font-size: x-small;">Project Mosul is a volunteer action by the fellows of the Initial Trianing Network for Digital Cultural Heritage (<a href="http://www.itn-dch.eu/" target="_blank">www.itn-dch.eu</a>),  a Marie Curie Actions training project that is part of the Seventh  Framework Programme. The fellows of the ITN-DCH are asking  </span><br /><h2><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Project Mosul: Call For Action</span></h2><span style="font-size: x-small;">We are looking for volunteers to help virtually restore the Mosul  Museum. This includes finding photos, processing data, contributing to  the website and generally helping out with organising the effort to  identify the museum artefacts. If you can help, drop us a line <a href="http://projectmosul.itn-dch.net/contact">here</a>, or e-mail us directly at projectmosul@itn-dch.net.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>For an example of how crowd-sourced images can help restore artefacts, check out this example <a href="http://neshmi.tumblr.com/post/113110702891/project-mosul" target="_blank">here</a></strong></span><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">Thanks!</span><br /> <h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">How can I help?</span></h3><ol><li>    <span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Upload Pictures</strong></span><br />     <span style="font-size: x-small;">We need pictures of the artefacts found in the Mosul Museum.  These pictures allow us to digitally reconstruct the original artefacts,  and can eventually aid in the restoration those artefacts. The more  pictures the better, and as many angles and perspectives, even better  still!</span><br />     <span style="font-size: x-small;">If you have pictures to contribute, search for the artefact in  the list of artefacts and simply edit that artefact, adding your photos  to the collection.</span><br />   </li><li>    <span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Develop the Web Platform</strong></span><br />     <span style="font-size: x-small;">Know how to code in Ruby on Rails, Angular, or Go? Why not  contribute to the web framework and help combat the destruction of ISIS  with your coding skills. Visit the GitHub project page (<a href="https://github.com/neshmi/projectmosul" target="_blank">https://github.com/neshmi/projectmosul</a>) and check out the issues. Fork the repository, make a change and issue a pull request.</span><br />   </li><li>    <span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Mask Some Images</strong></span><br />     <span style="font-size: x-small;">Our results will be improved if we can mask the artefacts in the  images. Help us by masking some of the images in Photoshop (we are  working on developing a web platform for the masking), save the mask in  an alpha channel. This takes time, so the more hands we have the easier  this task wll be!</span><br />   </li><li>    <span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Get the word out</strong></span><br />     <span style="font-size: x-small;">Know someone who has visited Mosul? Let them know about the  project. We need as many pictures from inside and outside the building,  the more people we can reach the greater the possibilities are of  virtual restoration.</span><br />   </li><li>    <span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Process an artefact!</strong></span><br />     <span style="font-size: x-small;">Do you know how to use automated photogrammetry to create  three-dimensional models? Help us by downloading some of the photosets  and processing the images.</span><br />   </li></ol><h2><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Project Mosul: Live Chat</span></h2><span style="font-size: x-small;">In order to facilitate the communication between volunteers and coordinators, we've setup a <a href="http://www.slack.com/">Slack</a> team for Projec Mosul. To join, please go to <a href="https://projectmosul.github.io/">https://projectmosul.github.io/</a> to sign up. You will get a confirmation e-mail and be able to join the <a href="http://www.slack.com/">Slack</a> chat shortly. Hope to see you there!</span><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">We have also setup a Google Group, in case people don't want to deal with a live chat environment. You can access the group at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/project-mosul">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/project-mosul</a>.</span><br />  <h1><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Project Mosul: A Manifesto</span></h1><span style="font-size: x-small;">The video circulated around the 26th of February, 2015 shows the  horrific destruction of the Mosul Museum by ISIS Fighters. This is not  the first time this museum has suffered during times of conflict, but  the destruction is nearly absolute, and this time we can respond through  the application of digital technologies to cultural heritage.</span><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">We assume that much of the museum’s contents were looted, and  anything small enough to be easily removed will be appearing soon on the  antiquities market. Anything too large to remove for sale, appears to  have met a violent end at the hand of ISIS extremists. In both cases, it  is possible to virtually recreate the lost items through the  application of photogrammetry and crowdsourcing. Given enough  photographs, digital or scans of analogues, it is possible to  reconstruct the artefacts and create digital surrogates of those  artefacts. This provides two immediate benefits: helping to identify  looted items and recreating destroyed items.</span><br />   <span style="font-size: x-small;">We propose to coordinate a volunteer effort of experts and amateurs  in the crowdsourcing of the necessary digital imagery and the creation  of digital surrogates for the artefacts in the museum. We would like to  work with the local management of the Mosul Museum as much as possible,  as well as with experts familiar with the collection and material. All  data generated from this project will be freely available to the public.</span><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">This project is a direct response to the senseless destruction of  cultural heritage by extremists, not only ISIS, but to any group who  uses heritage as leverage or political power. Instead, we want to bring  heritage back to life through digital tools, giving the public access to  any destroyed heritage, starting with the Mosul Museum.</span><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">We ask for your support in this endeavour, a project we are  voluntarily doing and hope that it will make heritage accessible to all  the public.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sincerely the undersigned:  <br />Marinos Ioannides, project coordinator<br />Matthew L. Vincent, Early Stage Researcher<br />Chance M. Coughenour, Early Stage Researcher</span></blockquote>]]></content>
