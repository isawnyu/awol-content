    <title type="text">Open Access Journal: Annales d’Université „Valahia” Târgoviste. Section
      d’Archéologie et d’Histoire</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.annalesfsu.ro/">Annales d’Université „Valahia”
      Târgoviste. Section d’Archéologie et d’Histoire</a><br /><blockquote><span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="FR">The magazine <b>Annales d’Université
      „Valahia” Târgovişte. </b></span><b> Section d’Archéologie et
      d’Histoire</b> &nbsp;has appeared since 1999, representing an opportunity to valorize
      the research work of the academic staff from the History-Archeology Department, and also a
      chance to valorize the research work of the young teaching staff who carry out their activity
      at the Research Centers accredited by CNCSIS – <i> „Preistorie, arheologie
      interdisciplinară şi conservarea patrimoniului cultural mobil” </i>(Prehistory,
      Interdisciplinary Archeology and Conservation of the Movable Cultural Patrimony) and<i>
      Centrul de Cercetare al Istoriei Relaţiilor Internaţionale „Grigore Gafencu”</i> (The
      “Grigore Gafencu” Center for the Research of the History of the International
      Relations)<i>. </i>For objective (especially financial) reasons, in order to
      maintain our quality standards, from the moment when the Annals of “Valahia” University began
      to appear on sections, sometimes we have published the results of two years of researches in a
      single tome, trying to preserve the continuity of the publication. Beginning with 2008, the
      magazine will appear with two annual issues. The themes have remained constant throughout the
      issues that were published so far in the domain of history and archeology, always covering all
      the historical periods – prehistory and archeology, history and archeology of the Middle Ages,
      modern and contemporary history. The structure of our magazine maintained its classical form:
      Articles and studies; Notes and Debates; Reviews. The standards of quality have been ensured by
      the presence in the Publishing Team and Advisory Board of the most representative personalities
      in the domain of research for each historical period, from Romania and abroad, in the sense
      that each contribution was submitted to the appreciation of the members of the magazine’s
      Publishing Team and Advisory Board by means of specialized reviews. The articles and studies
      published in the <b>Annales d’Université „Valahia” Târgovişte, Section d’Archéologie et
      d’Histoire</b> have been published integrally in a language of large international
      circulation (English, French, German, Italian), having a permanent scientific impact, in the
      sense that they have often been quoted in the studies of our colleagues from Romania and
      abroad. At the same time, <b> Annales d’Université Valahia Targoviste, Section
      d’Archéologie et d’Histoire </b>have been included in several international databases.
      The magazine is remarkable for its extremely original contributions in the domain of
      prehistoric archeology, produced by a school that has been acknowledged in its domain and whose
      results have been appreciated not just nationally but also internationally, given the fact that
      it has carried out many research programs in collaboration with numerous universities from
      Europe, like those from Liège, Bordeaux I, Aix-en-Provence, the Musée de l’Homme and the
      Institute of Human Paleontology from Paris, Erlanger and Köln University from Germany etc. The
      results of such researches have often been the topic of articles included in the
      <b>Annales d’Université „Valahia” Targoviste, Section d’Archéologie et
      d’Histoire</b>. At the same time, in this magazine can be found studies of many of our
      colleagues from other universities from Romania and abroad. The magazine is present in the
      libraries of many universities from Europe and the U.S.A., in most of the universities from
      Romania where there is the specialization History and in the libraries of history museums, and
      of other institutions with which we have had a permanent exchange, which has led to the
      improvement of the patrimony of publications of “Valahia” University Târgovişte.
