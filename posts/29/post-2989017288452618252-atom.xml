      Egypt</i></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Tell Hebua is
      situated on the eastern bank of the Suez Canal, in north-east Sinai, about 4km from the city
      Al-Qantara East. The three sites at Hebua represent an agglomeration located on the edge of a
      paleo-lagoon. Excavation carried out recently has revealed a defense system represented by
      fortresses reinforced with towers and surrounding administrative and religious buildings, with
      palaces and domestic structures of the New Kingdom and Late Period. Tell Hebua II, which is
      750m south-east of Hebua I, has yielded a massive structure representing a fortified city and
      containing a series of magazines and a religious complex of the New Kingdom. Hebua III which
      lies about 1km south-east of Hebua II, includes domestic structures with many silos and bread
      ovens, with serpentine walls and many ox burials. The discovery of fortified cities at Hebua
      (Tjarou) has confirmed inscriptions on the walls of Karnak of the reign of Sety I who described
      the fortresses and installations of North Sinai.</span><br /><br

      (Qedua): Saite Fortresses on Egypt’s Eastern Frontier. </i></span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The excavation at Tell al-Kedwa was undertaken by
      an Egyptian archaeological mission (2008). The site of Tell al-Kedwa lies on flat ground 25km
      north-east of Al-Qantara East. Tell al-Kedwa was occupied by a military fortification which
      dated to the Saite Period. Previous excavations had revealed a massive square mud-brick
      fortress 200m x 200m. The SCA excavation showed that there was more than one fortress at Tell
      al-Kedwa. Two forts of the Saite Period have been found; the earlier structure (fort A) dates
      from the beginning of the Saite Period, the later one (fort B) dates from the second half of
      the same period.</span><br /><h2><span style="font-size:

      x-small;"><i>The Wadi Tumilat in Antiquity and Today</i></span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Two major surveys of the Wadi Tumilat have been
      undertaken, the first by Schott in the late 1920s and the other by Holladay in the late 1970s
      and early 1980s. These surveys revealed the presence of several multi-period sites in the
      western Wadi Tumilat but their conclusions were that the Wadi Tumilat only had major occupation
      from the Late Period and only minor traces of earlier occupation could be discerned. The
      discovery of the large Predynastic to Early Dynastic Periods site of Kafr Hassan Dawood in the
      late 1980s challenged this perceived knowledge. The continued analysis of the excavated
      material remains indicates that the site was occupied from 3,400 BC to 2,700 BC and possibly
      earlier, making it contemporary with earliest remains at Minshat Abu Omar. Analysis of the
      later remains at the site, which were preliminarily dated to Late Period to Ptolemaic also
      indicate that the occupation continued for longer. The results of the current analysis of both
      periods, relating to the excavations in the 1990s, will be presented.<br

      Rose</b></span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Tell
      el-Dab'a/Avaris/Recent Results</i></span><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Investigation of the landscape at Tell el-Dab’a/Avaris (under the excavation
      concession of the Austrian Archaeological Institute, Cairo branch, since 1966), has long been
      an integral element of the research, and began before landscape archaeology became popular. The
      focus of this paper is on area R/III where excavations were undertaken from 2010-12 to combat
      the ongoing destruction of archaeological remains by modern agricultural activity. The area was
      divided, by streets running from north-north-west to south-south-east and converging towards
      the south, into several insulae. Two different quarters of Avaris could be distinguished, and
      thus provided the opportunity to conduct a study on the function of individual areas in the
      central part of the town. In the western part (an administrative quarter consisting of one
      block) spacious buildings dating to the later Second Intermediate Period were discovered, while
      the eastern district, with narrower side streets, is a typical domestic town quarter with a
      layout common at Avaris. In contrast to the western district, tombs were found within this
      domestic quarter, as was usual in domestic quarters at Avaris in the Second Intermediate
      Period. Besides other finds over 1,000 sealing impressions were found in this area: including
      some with royal names such as that of King Khyan of the 15th Dynasty.</span><br

      Lehmann</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Skylines,
      bridges and mud in the Delta and elsewhere</i></span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">In this lecture I would like to present the latest results of
      the ongoing research at Tell el-Dab’a into developments of the Late Period and early Ptolemaic
      Period, when, as at many other sites in the Delta, the pattern of the settlement changes
      dramatically compared to earlier periods due to a new type of architecture in Egypt. This type
      is also found in other places in the ancient Near East and is partly still in use today. An
      ethnoarchaeological comparison between the ancient Delta and modern Yemen gives surprisingly
      fruitful insights into this building type, its construction and the ways people deal with this
      architecture.</span><br /><h2><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a

      style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Small harbours in the Nile Delta: the case of Tell
      el-Dab’a</i></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The basis
      for the reconstruction of the historic landscape in the region of Tell el-Dab’a is
      geomorphological research carried out in the 1990s by J. Dorner. Magnetic survey since 1999 has
      helped to define the position of the Pelusiac Nile branch, outline the floodplain limits,
      define precisely the locations of settled areas and their layouts, and identify possible
      locations of the main ports. Moreover, the precise picture of the shoreline provided by the
      survey allowed the identification of what may have been small harbours, two of which - in the
      area of Ezbet il-Ezzawin and Ezbet Mehesin - are the theme of this paper. Magnetic mapping
      suggests that the waterfronts were artificially formed and clearly show a vacant space between
      the waterfront and the settlement edge. The magnetic image of sediments filling the riverbed
      may indicate that it had been deepened. Electro-resistivity survey was carried out using the
      vertical electrical sounding method and the resulting measurements support the hypothesis of
      the artificial formation of waterfronts, demonstrating that materials of a high resistivity
      (most probably with a high content of sand or gravel) were used in their construction. Test
      drilling in Ezbet il-Ezzawin showed the presence of bricks with a high sand
      content.</span><br /><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br

      x-small;"><i>Egyptian rescue excavation in Tell el-Retaba</i></span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Tell el-Retaba is a major dynastic-period site in
      northern Egypt and like many other sites in Egypt it is under constant threat of destruction.
      An asphalt road linking Cairo with the city of El-Qantara was built through Tell el-Retaba some
      years ago and current development of this road into a multi-lane highway was approved by
      Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities on the condition that full archaeological excavations
      should first take place. The salvage project covered an area approximately 230m long
      (north-south) and 10m wide (east-west) and the rescue excavation has added important new data
      on the long settlement history of the site from the Second Intermediate Period until the Late
      Period.</span><br /><br /><h3><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Aiman Ashmawy Ali</span></h3><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><i>The SCA excavation at Tell Basta 2002</i></span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;">In 2002 the SCA carried out an excavation in the
      area to the north of the great temple of Bastet and east of the excavation site of 2001. It is
      a high mound with a pointed top which slopes sharply in its northern part. In the upper level
      the foundation of complete house was discovered and parts of three other mud-brick houses,
      beside a well built of red bricks. The houses (probably 30th Dynasty or early Ptolemaic Period)
      seemed to be laid out in regular orthogonal plan indicating pre-planned settlements which might
      have belonged to workers involved in the temple activities of Nectanebo II at Bubastis. The
      northern part of the site is 2m deep and excavation here uncovered parts of a large building,
      most probably a palace or a large house, beside two earlier silos. The building is dated, by
      ceramic evidence, to the 26th Dynasty. A layer of burned ash was discovered around the silos
      and between the walls - similar to the units with burnt ash discovered in 2001 within the
      buildings to the west, which represent magazines. The discovery of ash in the magazines added
      to our knowledge about ancient measures to protect the grain and control insects and mites, by
      using ash, mud and sand.</span><br /><h2><span style="font-size:

      Bubastis and its hinterland</i></span><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">The famous description of Herodotus about the Temple of Bastet at Bubastis focuses
      on the existence of two canals (the ‘Isheru’ or sacred lake) surrounding the temple,
      transforming it into an island. These canals were fed by the Nile branch which passed very
      close to Bubastis. Previously the account of Herodotus seemed to be the only available source
      for the existence of the canals, but recent research at the site has produced archaeological
      evidence for them. They formed the core of a sacred landscape, built for the cult of Bastet.
      However, the Isheru of Bubastis have to be considered as only a part of the picture of the
      hydrogeography of the city and its surrounding territory - the situation of Bubastis adjacent
      to two main Nile branches of the Delta, and its evolution, is strongly connected to the
      existence of access to those waterways. Any attempt to reconstruct the history of the city
      needs to be based on the investigation of its hydrogeography: the course of the Nile branches,
      artificial canals and the possible location of the harbour of Bubastis.</span><br

      prancing is indeed a thing of beauty’. On ‘rider’ terracottas from Tell
      Basta</i></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">During various
      excavations in Lower Egypt clay statuettes have been found, consisting of separately formed
      horses and mounted bearded riders. The distinctive appearance has led not only to different
      identifications, but also to ethnic interpretations. Common are appellations such as
      ‘Scythians’ or ‘Persian Riders’ whereby a connection with a multi-ethnic Nile Delta is implied.
      This reading might be supported by the dating of the figurines to the third century BC, in the
      Egyptian Late Period, separating the type from Egyptian coroplastic production during the later
      Hellenistic Period or the Roman Period. The Tell Basta Project so far has found about 65
      fragments of horse-and-rider-figurines of this iconographic pattern; enough material to assess
      in comparison with previous discussions and to try to establish a classification for this
      specific terracotta group.</span><br /><br /><h3><span

      historical geography.</i></span><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">This paper tries to assess the strategic importance of the eastern Delta by the
      position and character of palaces at the easternmost Nile branch from the Middle Kingdom to the
      Ramesside Period. It also tries to put the palatial quarters into the context of the historical
      geography of the eastern Delta.</span><br /><br /><h3><span

      overview</i></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Old
      Kingdom in the Nile Delta is much less well-attested than many later or even earlier periods.
      Since there are still too few sites where Old Kingdom remains have been identified and properly
      studied, the aim of this presentation is not to propose even a hypothetic reconstruction of the
      settlement network but to comment on the geographic distribution of those sites which are
      known. A map of Old Kingdom Delta sites shows a great disproportion in settlement density and
      types of archaeological remains, which can not be explained only by the distribution of
      research projects. The Nile Delta in the Old Kingdom was quite different from its modern state
      in aspects of its geography and environmental conditions and can be divided into three main
      regions: in the eastern Delta developed urban settlements were located on geziras as well as on
      the levées. In the south-western Delta very often only the levées had suitable conditions for
      permanent settlement and the small amount of ground which was habitable during the flood season
      may have influenced settlement density. The northern Delta seems to have been much less densely
      settled in the Old Kingdom but the small amount of archaeological data may not signify an
      absence of settlements, but might indicate that it took a different form in this more swampy
      area.<br />&nbsp;</span><br /><h3><span style="font-size:

      el-Sinbellawein - a few red bricks and pottery sherds are distributed on the tell; Tell
      el-Lugga, about 20km south-east of Sinbellwein and about 5km from Tell el-Farkha, near Ezbet
      Wahby; Kom el-Hammamat - one of the registered archaeological sites of Bilqeis, together with

      vanish due to global climatic changes: a research paper on the management of archaeological
      sites </i></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">This paper
      aims to draw attention to many recent alerts from international and local institutes, warning
      of the seriousness of sea-level rise due to global climate change all over the world. The
      impact on Egypt could be severe, and in Kafr Ash-Sheikh Governorate these changes (if they
      happen) will result in the disappearance of many archaeological tells. This paper proposes a
      survey project to study endangered tells and to decide how we will face this problem which
      surely will require the collaboration of authorities - including the Ministry of State for
      Antiquities - to study the consequences of climate change and to devise the needed careful
      preventive measures to avoid devastating effects on the archaeological tells close to the sea
      in Delta areas. The basic idea of the project is to prepare an urgent salvage plan to address
      the negative impacts expected on archaeological tells in Kafr Ash-Sheikh Governorate which will
      be endangered by the effects of climate change. A three-phase plan of action is proposed: (1)
      conducting preliminary archaeological surveys of all archaeological tells within the endangered
      area, making use of the SCA datasheet; (2) developing a rescue excavation plan and identifying
      the equipment needed and finally (3) carrying out the excavations.</span><br

      2012 the Regional Survey around Buto (Tell el-Farain), conducted by the German Archaeological
      Institute Cairo, focused its investigations on areas in the vicinity of Buto. Work was
      conducted in fields north-east of Buto in areas today used as agricultural land and on the
      freestanding tell of Kom el-Gir, about 4km north-east of Buto. The complete loss of small
      ancient sites, marked as tells on early Survey of Egypt maps and often still detectable on 40
      year old satellite images (Corona) can be observed. These sites have almost entirely
      disappeared below the current surface. Magnetometric prospection at the freestanding site of

      Firstly, investigating the evolution of the city through a new method of extensive survey
      mapping in 2012 on an area over 11,000 m2 in the northern part of Kôm A. One of the first aims
      of this survey was to highlight, for the Kom A area initially, the limits of the town of Buto
      during the late phases of its occupation, from the Late Period to the beginning of the Islamic
      Period. Secondly, studies on the Hellenistic and Roman innovations of the bath buildings in
      sector P10 (Ptolemaic to the Roman times) where the EES worked in the 1960s, and (in
      collaboration with the MSA Inspectorate of Kafr el-Sheikh) in the Ptolemaic baths near the

      Athribis, and in the region of Khatatbah, which represents one of the earliest areas for
      temporary and permanent settlers in the Nile Delta. At Quesna, investigations have focused on
      the Ptolemaic-Roman cemetery and also the corridors of the sacred falcon necropolis, where
      there is now further inscriptional evidence to link Quesna with Athribis, and the first from
      the EES investigations in the falcon necropolis in particular. Excavations in the cemetery have
      continued to inform about the range of medical conditions and trauma which affected the
      population, as well as providing new information on the range of burial types. At Khatatbah,
      summer 2011 saw a specialised team visiting survey areas within a 5km tract of land south of
      the modern town. The finds range throughout the Palaeolithic Period and into the Neolithic
      Period and provide a starting point for a more focused survey with palaeoenvironmental
      reconstruction in spring 2013.</span><br /><br /><h3><span

      necropolis. In view of its importance, the Faculty of Arts, Minufiyeh University decided to
      complete the archaeological excavations (halted in 2009) in the south side of the
      archaeological area, of the brick-built mausoleum containing burials of the Late and Ptolemaic
      Periods, overlaid by Roman burials. The aims were to complete the excavation of the mausoleum,
      to try to find any evidence of other structures, to study burial patterns and positions, and to
      research Egyptian religion and architecture in the period when the mausoleum was in use. Work
      started on the north side of the mausoleum and has revealed additional features which will be
      described during the paper.</span><br /><br /><h3><span

      (Kom Wasit). The Italian Archaeological Mission in the western Nile
      Delta</i></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">During the
      Beheira Survey Project conducted between 2008 and 2011 in the western Delta, eight sites of
      wine production, seven sites of olive oil production, four amphorae workshops, and probably
      Metelis, the capital of the nomos, were discovered and documented, in addition to sixty-six
      other sites. The rediscovery of the first documented plant nursery underscored the importance
      of the region from an economic perspective. As a result of the survey, the economic importance
      of the western Delta can be compared with Alexandria and the rest of Egypt. In 2012 excavation
      and survey started at Kom al-Ahmer (Kom Wasit), yielding some important finds that demonstrate
      the economic importance of the site. There were also significant pottery finds (fourth-seventh
      centuries AD) with imports accounting for 75% percent of the amphorae - the majority from
      Cilicia. This confirmation of direct contact with Mediterranean ports and a large unidentified
      structure has encouraged us to continue our excavations.</span><br

      /><span style="font-size: x-small;">During the seasons 2012-13 excavations at Tell
      el-Farkha were continued on all three koms. On the Western Kom, fieldwork was carried out
      within the older trench that had been opened in 2006 and excavation undertaken in the layers
      between the oldest phases of the administrative-cultic centre (Naqada IIIB) and the top layers
      of burnt Naqadian residence, partly excavated in 2003-04 (Naqada IIIA-Naqada IID2/IIIA). On the
      Central Kom, the trench was extended to the west. A building with massive mud-brick walls
      (1.5m-1.7m thick) dated to Naqada III B was discovered there. A new trench for verification of
      the results of geophysical research was also opened on the north-western slope of the kom. A
      rounded building 7m in diameter on the interior, and with a 2m thick wall, was discovered
      there. It had been destroyed at the beginning of the Third Dynasty. The excavations in 2013
      should identify the function of that construction. On the Eastern Kom, works were concentrated
      around the large structure found in 2004 (a mastaba). We found a group of the rooms bordered on
      the north by a m thick wall and a similar wall was also found to the south of the
      mastaba.</span><br /><br /><h3><span style="font-size:

      /><span style="font-size: x-small;">At Tell el-Farkha approximately120 excavated tombs
      belong to three distinct cemeteries associated with the Protodynastic and Early Dynastic
      Periods and the Old Kingdom, and many have mastaba superstructures. The oldest mastaba at Tell
      el-Farkha (NIIIA2/B1) is also the largest and the most monumental. Not long after, a new
      necropolis was started next to, and partially over, the abandoned large mastaba. The impressive
      mastaba tombs which make up the cemetery were constructed for members of a wealthy society and
      they demonstrate the high status of their owners. The so-called Early Dynastic graves reflect
      the changing political fortunes of the settlement at Tell el-Farkha but also show deeper
      evolution within the social structure of the young Egyptian kingdom. Although burials from this
      phase of the cemetery were far more diversified and usually rather poor, quite monumental
      mastabas were also constructed. The latest graves represent the final decline of the settlement
      and were only the simplest pit burials. The use of mastaba tombs at Tell el-Farkha lasted about
      500 years and corresponded to the most prosperous period of the settlement. Their study makes a
      major contribution to our knowledge of early Egyptian burial customs and the development of
      typical Egyptian mastaba tombs.</span><br /><br /><h3><span

      style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Nile Delta foreign relations during the Pre- and Early
      Dynastic Periods in the light of excavations at Tell el-Farkha</i></span><br
      /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Since 1998 a Polish team has been excavating at
      Tell el-Farkha in the eastern Nile Delta. Archaeologists believe that ‘Chicken Mound’ (the
      meaning of the name in English) played an important role in relations between the southern
      Levant and Egypt. The time of the site’s greatest flourishing corresponds with the development
      of the so-called ‘Egyptian colony’ in Palestine. According to various surveys conducted in the
      Nile Delta, Tell el-Farkha was a nodal point on the route from Upper Egypt to the southern
      Levant, located at a crossroad with the passage leading into the Western Delta. A high number
      of imported pottery fragments and locally made imitations underlines the role of the site in
      long range trade. This paper will once again reexamine the arguments supporting this theory,
      showing the most important objects of Levantine provenance and locally-made imitations. The
      latter part of the paper will present also non-pottery evidence of contacts discussing, among
      other points, commodities that Tell el-Farkha was able to send to the
      Levant.</span><br /><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br

      Geif) 2012 field season</i></span><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">In October 2012 the first British Museum fieldwork season at Naukratis was
      conducted by members of the Museum’s Naukratis Project. Naukratis was the earliest and, for a
      period, the only Greek port in Egypt. Established in the late seventh century BC as a base for
      Greek (and Cypriot) traders, and the port of Sais, Naukratis was an important hub for trade and
      cross-cultural exchange with artefacts from the site spanning the late seventh century BC to
      the seventh century AD (at least). The new fieldwork complements the Project’s study of earlier
      excavations (by Petrie, Hogarth and Leonard/Coulson), clarifying their results and the helping
      to contextualise artifacts (see the open access catalogue: www.britishmuseum.org/naukratis).
      This research has advanced our understanding of the site, particularly of the full extent of
      the city, its geomorphology, harbour, structures and development over time. During the first
      fieldwork season an accurate map of the site was produced by recording all visible
      archaeological features, by tying previous excavations and surveys to our survey, and by the
      identification of new archaeological features through the use of
      magnetometry.</span><br /><h2><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a

      simple basic scientific rules for exploration has revealed more than twenty archaeological
      sites in Alexandria during the last two years. These sites help us to understand the complex
      topography of the city during its long life. They vary between rock tombs, pottery graves and
      simple inhumations spanning the period from the Hellenistic to Byzantine eras for pagans and
      Christians, especially in the eastern side of the city. The western side yielded simple and
      complex cisterns from the Roman Period to the Ottoman Period. In the middle of the city parts
      of streets have been discovered. Study of these sites, as well as of the associated objects, is
      in process.</span><br /><br /><h3><span style="font-size:

      problems</i></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The
      collection of information from Delta sites has resulted in a wealth of data from areas of the
      Delta, at varying degrees of resolution. Ground survey, mapping, artefact and pottery recording
      allied with satellite imagery and local knowledge have produced a mosaic of material, some of
      which has been published (van den Brink, Bietak, Wilson &amp; Grigoropoulos) or is publicly
      available through the Delta EES Survey website. This paper is an attempt to evaluate the survey
      data and its coverage, to measure the amount of work still to be done and to raise particular
      questions and problems with colleagues. In particular: how useful is site visiting without
      other topographical work in the satellite-survey age? To what extent can local knowledge and
      interests be built into site work (the cultural heritage co-efficient)? What is the intended
      legacy of the survey work – for all archaeologists, geographers and government agencies
      interested in the work (looking at the EAIS objectives)? What overall chronological, geological
      and humanistic frameworks are applicable? How can the Delta Survey be augmented in a low-cost,
      low-tech way by researchers in Egypt (training and funding, quality
      control)?</span><br /><br /><h3><span style="font-size:

      example of a Ptolemaic and Roman period metropolis from destruction, while studying an
      invaluable source of history of the life, economy, and culture of Egypt in Late Antiquity. The
      work at Thmuis is writing a new chapter of Egyptian history in the Nile Delta. Here we present
      the introduction to that chapter with an archaeological overview of the history of the town and
