    <title type="text">ROMURBITAL – ROM(AN PERIOD) URB(ANISM ON THE) ITAL(IAN PENINSULA)</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://romurbital.wordpress.com/">ROMURBITAL – ROM(AN PERIOD)
      URB(ANISM ON THE) ITAL(IAN PENINSULA)</a><br /><blockquote
      class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">I am a British archaeologist with a
      professional background as a digger and a researcher of ancient urbanism in Italy. This blog
      accompanies and promotes my two-year research project (2012-2014) at <a
      href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/archaeology/" target="_blank" title="Archaeology at
      Durham">Durham University</a> to create an analytical database of c.600 urban and
      proto-urban sites that once existed south of the <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_%28river%29" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">Po
      River</a> during the period 350BC to AD300. The project is funded by a Marie Curie
      Intra-European Fellowship, and I have been lucky enough to be supervised by <a
      href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/archaeology/staff/?id=1204/" target="_blank">Rob
      Witcher</a>, an experienced landscape archaeologist based at Durham. I sought Rob’s
      expertise because the methodology developed for the project is adapted from landscape
      archaeology: a database and a GIS. These computer-based analytical tools are used
      for&nbsp;the study of rural sites in micro-regions. For this project they have
      been&nbsp;applied in generally the same way, just on a different scale: a large landmass
      dotted with (proto-)urban centres.</span><br /><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">In 2015 the results will be published and the database will be
      made freely available online. Meanwhile, here I want to increase awareness of
      the&nbsp;project by explaining more about it, but I also want to share with you some of the
      more weird and interesting&nbsp;archaeological sites I have encountered. Before starting
      the project, I thought I had a good basic understanding of the Italian archaeology
      from&nbsp;the period in which I’m interested, but I underestimated&nbsp;the incredible
      variety of sites that have been discovered. The published results of the project will take the
      form of quantitative and geospatial analyses, in which there will be little space for
      discussing individual sites. So&nbsp;with this blog I have the
      opportunity&nbsp;to&nbsp;introduce the ancient settlements that have fascinated me
      most.</span></blockquote>]]></content>
