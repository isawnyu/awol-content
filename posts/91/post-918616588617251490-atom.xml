      <span style="font-size:85%;"><img alt=""
      src="http://www.archaeological.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/med_thumbnail/BrianRose.jpg"
      style="width: 154px; height: 200px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; float:
      left;" />When the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) was established in 1879, the
      telephone was in its infancy and the radio was still a decade or more away. Inventors such as
      Bell, Tesla, and Marconi revolutionized how we communicated in the late 19th century, but even
      greater steps were made in the late 1930s, with the advent of television, and 1940s, with
      digital computers. During this time, the AIA reached out to the public through lectures and,
      beginning in 1948, with ARCHAEOLOGY magazine. But even then, the power of “new” media was
      apparent, for example in the popularity of the 1950s television series “What in the World?”
      featuring artifacts, curators, and celebrities.</span></p> <p><span
      style="font-size:85%;"> Now when we talk of “new” media, however, we generally mean
      Web-based stories, audio files, video, and the like. The Web itself arose in the mid-1990s,
      soon after which both ARCHAEOLOGY and the AIA had established sites. Today, we are taking
      another step in bringing the ancient world to the public, and to professional AIA Members, as
      we re-launch the AIA website.</span></p> <p><span
      style="font-size:85%;"> Our staff in Boston has spent many hours on this project, guided by
      Eti Bonn-Muller, the AIA’s Manager of Online Communications (and ARCHAEOLOGY’s Online Senior
      Editor) and Web Designer Amélie Walker of Castle Builder Design. We hope you will find the site
      more user-friendly than before and even more informative about AIA’s mission, programs, and
      Membership benefits. Please take some time to explore our new site—and let us know what you
      think: <a href="http://www.archaeological.org/comment/reply/318#comment-form">leave
