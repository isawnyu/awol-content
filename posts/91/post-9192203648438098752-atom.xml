      href="http://theotheracropolis.com/">theotheracropolis.com</a><br /><div
      style="text-align: left;"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: black;
      font-size: x-small;">This photoblog is the first stage of a series of projects by
      <i>The Other Acropolis Collective</i>. We have a background in archaeology,
      anthropology, or media studies, and we all share a desire to intervene critically in the
      processes that often result in monolithic and exclusivist archaeological and heritage
      materialities in the present.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our aim is&nbsp; to produce a range of
      alternative media interventions which will take the iconic site of the Athenian Acropolis as
      their centre, their point of departure, or their target (in all senses of the word). This
      project is a follow-up from a number of other, more conventional academic projects, to do with
      issues such as the role of the Acropolis in nationalist and colonialist discourses and
      practices, the social, political, and sensual lives of its ruins, the ways by which the
      transformative power of archaeological and photographic apparatuses have produced and endlessly
      reproduced the site/sight of the Acropolis, the tourist experience of the site, and so on (see
      bibliography for some of these projects).</span><br /><br /> <span
      style="color: black; font-size: x-small;">This project can be seen as the attempt to
      undermine the monolithic discourse on the Acropolis as an exclusively classical site, by
      bringing into the fore its other lives, from prehistory to the present (the Mycenaean, the
      Medieval, the Ottoman, the Muslim, the Christian, the contemporaryâ€¦), especially through their
      material traces that still survive, despite the extensive processes of archaeological, but also
      photographic purification.&nbsp; We draw our inspiration from two concepts: the first is
      multi-temporality, and the second, multi-sensoriality.&nbsp; We believe that the site and
      the space around it constitute a unique locale which can re-activate different times, evoke
      different cultures, and reconnect with diverse and fluid identities. At the same time, we hope
      to encourage a fully embodied, multi-sensory appreciation and engagement with the materiality
      of the site, beyond the stereotypical, tourist gaze, or the national pilgrimage. &nbsp;We
      also favour the re-incorporation of this locale into the fabric of daily life, especially for
      the people who live around it. We hope that the thoughts and the material generated here will
      lead to other projects and interventions, some on site, some printed, some virtual, with more
      immediate a printed, portable alternative tourist guide for <i>The Other
      Acropolis</i>. We invite you to post your comment, share your thoughts, and if you are an
      artist or a researcher already working on a similar project, get in touch with
      us.</span></blockquote></div>]]></content>
