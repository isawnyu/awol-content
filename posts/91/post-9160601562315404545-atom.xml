Membership of the community is entirely open, and measured             only by the numbers of users of our various sites. There is no formal executive or             board; the most active members tend to take on administrative duties. As a general             principle, key sections of the website or summaries of discussions will, where possible,             be translated into the major languages of scholarship (dependent upon volunteer             translators).</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">                                   </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">In Memoriam: <a href="http://www.stoa.org/?p=786" target="_blank">Ross Scaife</a>            (1960-2008)</span><br /></blockquote>]]></content>
