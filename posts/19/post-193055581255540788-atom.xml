      x-small;">The Paleography of the Papyri</span></h5><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Individual letter-forms as well as larger units of text display paleographical
      features that are characteristic of the writing styles of the periods in which they originate.
      These features are often more pronounced when a text is written in cursive script than they are
      in capital or bookhands. Cursive and semi-cursive writing demonstrates a degree of
      individuality that is more easily perceived than in non-cursive texts. Thus, viewing
      documentary papyri dated to different periods provides a fairly clear impression of the basic
      style of the epoch in question. Ptolemaic hands are generally easy to distinguish from Roman,
      for example, and 5th and 6th c. script has a character unlike that of the 1st and 2nd c. Yet
      within these broad chronological contexts we encounter styles and conventions that depend on a
      range of criteria and circumstances, from the type of text that was recorded to the skill and
      experience of the writer. One can, for example, often observe distinct differences between the
      style of a receipt and that of a private letter; a chancery hand will look different from a
      list of expenditures recorded in the same year; and the Greek script of a native Latin writer
      will in some cases diverge significantly from that of a native Greek writer. In short, we find
      an impressive diversity of hands, and this variety frustrates simplistic attempts at a tidy
      description of the diachronic development of ancient writing. This is not to say that any kind
      of letter-form can be found in any given period. Quite the contrary, many letter-forms,
      ligatures, and writing styles are confined to specific places and times. But recognizing the
      wide spectrum of variations ultimately permits more accurate dating of undated hands, as well
      as better understanding of the factors that influence specific writing styles.</span>
      </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"> <span style="font-size: x-small;">In
      order to provide a reliable point of reference for the investigation of ancient writing, PapPal
      collects dated examples of hands from the 3rd c. BC to the 8th c. AD surviving mainly from
      Greco-Roman Egypt. Because many ancient documents preserved on papyrus are dated to the very
      day on which they were recorded, viewing them together brings out features that were typical of
      a time and, in some cases, of a place of writing. Furthermore, as no two hands are identical,
      comparison of a range of contemporary scripts also illuminates the variety of writing styles
      that existed.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The
      site currently contains primarily Greek papyri. We will soon be adding Greek ostraka and Latin
      documents.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">PapPal
      permits users to browse images by several different categories: year, provenance, title and
      keyword. Images can be viewed either as a list in which thumbnails are displayed in rows or as
      a slideshow. Links accompanying each text direct the user to the project that hosts the image
