   <title type="text">Online Coins of the Roman Empire (OCRE) News</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://numishare.blogspot.com/2016/10/ric-9-published-to-ocre.html">RIC 9 published to OCRE</a><br /> <div class="post-header"> </div><div class="post-body entry-content"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">RIC volume 9 has been published to <a href="http://numismatics.org/ocre">Online Coinage of the Roman Empire</a>.  This represents about 1,700 types and 3,200 subtypes. In total, there  are now more than 43,000 Roman Imperial coin types in OCRE, spread over  half a millennium from Augustus to Zeno. This was a huge undertaking  with many collaborators from the ANS and DAI, as well as contributors of  data from more than a dozen American and European cultural heritage  institutions. Without generous support from the <a href="https://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a>,  we may never have completed this project, which will officially come to  a close in December. Since publishing the types to OCRE yesterday, I  have begun the process  of harvesting relevant coins from partner institutions. The British  Museum alone has contributed an additional 11,600 RIC 9 coins to OCRE,  and the total number of physical specimens linked into the project  stands around 93,000. We hope to surpass 100,000 when the ANS and  Fitzwilliam Museum coins are added soon.<br /><br />Despite the official "end" of the project (with respect to meeting the  specifications of the original NEH grant application), the project will  continue to evolve in a variety of ways. We anticipate aggregating  content from more partners, especially from the archaeological  community. There are more than 200,000 Roman Imperial coins in the <a href="https://finds.org.uk/">Portable Antiquities Scheme</a>,  but so far barely over 300 have been linked to OCRE URIs. I am  continuing to build more sophisticated analysis and visualization  interfaces. These advancements have been implemented directly in <a href="http://nomisma.org/">Nomisma.org</a>, but I anticipate porting these code updates into OCRE and various other <a href="https://github.com/ewg118/numishare">Numishare</a>-based  coin type projects. We also plan to unveil two new features by the end  of this year: an intuitive coin type identification interface that  non-specialists (collectors or archaeologists working in the field)  might use to identity coins, and a faceted search function for  architecture depicted on Roman coinage (which extends into Republican  coins in <a href="http://numismatics.org/crro">CRRO</a>).<br /><br />While the NEH funding was instrumental in the development of OCRE  specifically, the open source code and the workflows we developed for  this project have had an impact on our ability to publish similar online  type corpora. In 2015, we saw the release of Coinage of the Roman  Republic Online and <a href="http://numismatics.org/pella">PELLA</a>.  Since the multilingual and visualization functionality are inherent to  Numishare, our other projects benefit from the funding the NEH invested  directly into OCRE. One of these, obviously, is the <a href="http://enl.numismatics.org/">Egyptian National Library collection of Islamic coinage</a>, which is available in both English and Arabic</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">.</span></div><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></blockquote></div><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <span class="post-author vcard">Posted by <span class="fn">Ethan Gruber</span></span></span><span class="post-timestamp"><span style="font-size: x-small;">at <a class="timestamp-link" href="http://numishare.blogspot.com/2016/10/ric-9-published-to-ocre.html" rel="bookmark" title="permanent link"><abbr class="published" title="2016-10-25T11:46:00-07:00">11:46 AM</abbr></a></span></span></blockquote>]]></content>
