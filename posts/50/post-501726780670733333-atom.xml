   <title type="text">Coming Soon: Archaeology and Text: A Journal for the Integration of Material Culture with Written Documents in the Ancient Mediterranean and Near East</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://archaeology-text.cas2.lehigh.edu/">Archaeology and Text: A Journal for the Integration of Material Culture with Written Documents in the Ancient Mediterranean and Near East</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The study of the human past has conventionally been divided between two  distinct academic disciplines depending upon the kind of evidence under  investigation: “history”, with its focus on written records, and  “archaeology”, which analyzes the remains of material culture.&nbsp;  Archaeology and Text: A Journal for the Integration of Material Culture  with Written Documents in the Ancient Mediterranean and Near East aims  to bridge this disciplinary divide by providing an international forum  for scholarly discussions which integrate the studies of material  culture with written documents. Interdisciplinary by nature, the journal  offers a platform for professional historians and archaeologists alike  to critically investigate points of confluence and divergence between  the textual and the artifactual. We seek contributions from scholars  working in the ancient Mediterranean and Near East.&nbsp; Contributions with a  theoretical or methodological focus on the interface between  archaeology and text are especially encouraged. By publishing all of its  articles online, the Archaeology and Text seeks to disseminate its  published papers immediately after the peer-review and editorial  processes have been completed, providing timely publication and  convenient access.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><ul class="menu primary-menu clearfix"><li class="menu-257 first active"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="active" href="https://archaeology-text.cas2.lehigh.edu/">Home</a></span></li><li class="menu-994"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="https://archaeology-text.cas2.lehigh.edu/content/editorial-policy">Editorial Policy</a></span></li><li class="menu-995"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="https://archaeology-text.cas2.lehigh.edu/content/instructions-contributors">Instructions for Contributors</a></span></li><li class="menu-993 last"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="https://archaeology-text.cas2.lehigh.edu/content/editorial-board">Editorial Board</a></span></li></ul></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">See the full <a href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2012/07/alphabetical-list-of-open-access.html">List of Open Access Journals in Ancient Studies</a> </div>]]></content>
