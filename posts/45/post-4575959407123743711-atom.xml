    <title type="text">Online Deposit of the Work of Individual Scholars</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of years ago, I began to collect a list of links to places where
      scholars were depositing copies of their originally print based word.<br /><blockquote
      class="tr_bq"><a
      href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2009/10/ancient-world-in-open-access.html">Ancient
      World in Open Access Institutional Repositories</a></blockquote>I have added to it
      on and off, but it remains far from comprehensive.&nbsp; This is increasingly the case as
      <a href="http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Unanimous_faculty_votes">institutions mandate the
      open access deposit of their faculty</a>'s intellectual product.&nbsp; Likewise <a
      href="http://www.openoasis.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=564%3Afunders-policy-on-open-access&amp;catid=78%3Aarticles&amp;Itemid=253">funding
      agencies are often requiring public access</a> to funded research.&nbsp; Emerging
      social media efforts such as <a href="http://academia.edu/">academia.edu</a> have
      simplified the deposit of (if not always the access to) facsimiles of print publicatons and are
      flooded with new data.&nbsp; Academia.edu is particularly rich in scholars and scholarship
      on antiquity.&nbsp; Many others are simple depositing pdf copies of their articles on
      private webspace.<br /><br />It is virtually impossible for one person to maintain
      anything like a comprehensive list, even within a single field, of scholars using these tools
      to disseminate their work.&nbsp; I wonder if there is another model, perhaps a wiki, where
      those who post their own work online, and those who encounter the work of others online could
      contribute to a cooperatively produced index.&nbsp; If you have any ideas along these
      lines, or would like to participate in such an venture, drop me a a line, or post a public
      comment below.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />]]></content>
