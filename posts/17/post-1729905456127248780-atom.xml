      </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div id="justtext"><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Publication of the materials from the archive of Karl
      Kazimirovich Kostsyushko-Valyuzhinich, the founder of the museum in Chersonesos, was rather
      complicated task. Everyone who participated in this project has put a part of his / her heart
      into it. We all worked hard, and you can see the result
      now.&nbsp;</span></div><div id="justtext"><br /></div><div
      id="justtext"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Use of this website allows you to
      trace how the scale of the studies increased year after year (you can see special time line
      above), how the excavations were recorded, how Chersonesos we know now was raising from under
      many-centuries-deep strata. However, the finds images of those are presented on this site
      scattered through different museums long ago, so they could hardly be brought together in
      reality. We collected them for you in <span id="btext">" Photographs "</span>
      section, though the drawings of the areas excavated every year are accumulated in <span
      id="btext">" Drawings "</span>.&nbsp;</span></div><div
      id="justtext"><br /></div><div id="justtext"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Texts section is digital version of the <span id="btext">" Reports
      "</span> of the excavations in Chersonesos, published by the Imperial Archaeological
      Commission in printed form. <span id="btext">" Manuscripts "</span> incorporate
      photos of manuscript reports by Kostsyushko; he made his reports in two copies: the first was
      sent to the Archaeological Commission, and the second remained in the archive of the museum
      established by him. The Commission developed printed version of the report on the background of
      Kostsyushko's manuscripts.&nbsp;</span></div><div id="justtext"><br
      /></div><div id="justtext"><span style="font-size: x-small;">From 1901,
      the Archaeological Commission begun to issue, apart from the Reports, its Proceedings
      (<i>Izvestiya Arkheologicheskoy Komissii</i>) that published the results of the
      excavations as scholarly articles. Several Kostsyushko's reports from this issue (they were not
      annual), as well as his articles from the Crimean newspapers have make the <span
      id="btext">" Publications "</span> section.&nbsp;</span></div><div
      id="justtext"><br /></div><div id="justtext"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Those who are interested in ancient inscriptions on stones will find some useful
      data in the <span id="btext">" Squeezes "</span>: here you can view photos of paper
      imprints of the inscriptions, which Kostsyushko made with great skill. Now squeezed are the
      most fragile articles within the collection and rarely appeared in scholars' hands because of
      that reason. Virtual squeezes will be much more available, and one inscription is presented as
      <a href="http://www.kostsyushko.chersonesos.org/3d/eng/enscript01_eng.html"
      target="_blank">three-dimensional
      reconstruction</a>.&nbsp;</span></div><div id="justtext"><br
      /></div><div id="justtext"><span style="font-size: x-small;">In order to
      make the elements of systematic excavations known to most large circle of history and
      archaeology lovers, we need to make English translation of the huge number of pages from our
      website. All the translations have been made by historian and archaeologist, in result of which
      the nineteenth century archaeological <span id="btext">" Lexicon "</span>
      developed. It will help modern reader understand some specific features of the style of the
      reports. </span></div><div id="justtext"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Here is the brief guide to our website, which is called after the most popular
      address to Kostsyushko from the correspondence: "Dear Karl Kazimirovich…" <span
      id="btext">Brief biographic essay</span> will make our website's visitors understand
      why this person was so respected by the
      contemporaries.&nbsp;</span></div><div id="justtext"><br
      /></div><div id="justtext"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Although the
      process of he site development was very hard for all of us, Kostsyushko's industry and his
      utterly devotion to his work were the great example to us. In the year 2007 we will celebrate
      the 160<sup>th</sup> birthday and the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of
      the death of Kostsyushko. By publishing this resource in the Web, we would like to honour these
      dates and to make Kostsyushko's life and merits widely known to the
      public.&nbsp;</span></div><div id="justtext"><br
      /></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">We are thankful for help and support
      to the authorities of the <a href="http://www.chersonesos.org/" target="_blank">National
      Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos</a>, our colleagues from the <a
