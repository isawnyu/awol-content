      </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">On
      Saturday 29 and Sunday 30 November 2014 a successful multidisciplinary conference on the Sinai
      Desert was held at the Netherlands-Flemish Institute in Cairo. In these Proceedings of the
      Multidisciplinary Conference on the Sinai Desert the reader will find a selection of papers
      read by participants during this conference. The Sinai Desert is a key area in many senses, and
      this peninsula has through the ages served as a natural land bridge between Asia and Africa.
      The multidisciplinary Sinai conference covered a wide variety of topics, such as: dialects
      spoken in Sinai today by Bedouin tribes, the proto-Sinaitic alphabet as discovered at Wadi
      Maghara, treasures of St. Catherine’s Monastery, small farming initiatives by Bedouin,
      archeological finds, customary law of the Bedouin, etc. </span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><br />The two days were divided into four sessions, each
      covering their own theme: topics in Archaeology, in History, Contemporary subjects and two
      sessions discussing different aspects of Heritage Conservation. The variety of topics was aptly
      illustrated by the variety of lecturers who presented their papers. Over 25 speakers
      participated, ranging from Egyptian, Italian and Greek scholars to inhabitants of the heart of
      the Sinai Desert: each lecturer talked about his or her subject with passion underscoring the
      uniqueness and diversity of the area. The conference was very well attended and was also well
      received by the participants themselves. The multidisciplinary approach allowed for a truly
      interdisciplinary exchange of thoughts between speakers and audience. We can look back on a
      very successful and interesting conference. We conclude that the conference reached its goal:
      to map at least some of the diversity of one of the historical key areas in the Middle Eastern
      region: the Sinai Desert. </span><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">We
      would like to thank all participants and everyone else involved in making this conference such
      a success. We owe special thanks to the Netherlands Embassy in Cairo for their generous
      support, which enabled us to organize the conference.&nbsp;</span><br /><br
