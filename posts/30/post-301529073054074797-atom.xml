   <title type="text">Online Exhibit:  Before Pythagoras</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/exhibitions/before-pythagoras/">Before Pythagoras: The Culture of Old Babylonian Mathematics</a><br /><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">Since the nineteenth century, thousands of cuneiform tablets dating                                 to the Old Babylonian Period (c. 1900-1700 BCE) have come to light                                 at various sites in ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>                                 (modern Iraq). A significant number record mathematical tables,                                 problems, and calculations. In the 1920s these tablets began to be                                 systematically studied by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_E._Neugebauer">Otto                                     Neugebauer</a>, who spent two decades transcribing and                                 interpreting tablets housed in European and American museums. His                                 labors, and those of his associates, rivals, and successors, have                                 revealed a rich culture of mathematical practice and education that                                 flourished more than a thousand years before the Greek sages <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales">Thales</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>                                 with whom histories of mathematics used to begin.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">This exhibition is the first to explore the world of Old Babylonian                                 mathematics through cuneiform tablets covering the full spectrum of                                 mathematical activity, from arithmetical tables copied out by young                                 scribes-in-training to sophisticated work on topics that would now                                 be classified as number theory and algebra. The pioneering research                                 of Neugebauer and his contemporaries concentrated on the                                 mathematical content of the advanced texts; a selection of archival                                 manuscripts and correspondence offers a glimpse of Neugebauer's                                 research methods and his central role in this “heroic                                 age.”</span></blockquote><blockquote><div id="body"><blockquote><h2><a href="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/exhibitions/before-pythagoras/highlights.html"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Highlights from the Exhibition</span></a></h2><div class="highlight" id="B6063obv"><div class="image"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/exhibitions/before-pythagoras/items/b-6063/" title="Click for more information about this tablet (B6063)"><img alt="Photograph of the obverse side of tablet B 06063" src="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/exhibitions/before-pythagoras/images/B6063o-thumb.png" /></a></span>                         </div><div class="label"><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/exhibitions/before-pythagoras/items/b-6063/" title="Click for more information about this tablet (B6063)">University of Pennsylvania Museum B6063</a></span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">This multiplication table was written by a student named Gan-Gal as a                                 demonstration of his skill as a scribe. <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/exhibitions/before-pythagoras/items/b-6063/">Click here to learn more.</a></span><br /><div class="image-credit"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Image by University of Pennsylvania Museum.
