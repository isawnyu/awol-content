   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/asor-staff">Friends of ASOR Podcasts</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://asorblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/FRIENDSOFASORfinalweb.png" class="decoded" height="82" src="https://asorblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/FRIENDSOFASORfinalweb.png" width="200" /> </blockquote><div class="userText__expanded"><blockquote><div><span style="font-size: x-small;">The American Schools of  Oriental Research (ASOR) is a non-profit 501 (c)3 organization that  supports and encourages the study of the cultures and history of the  Near East, from the earliest times to the present. ASOR is apolitical  and has no religious affiliation.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">We were founded in 1900 by  twenty one institutionsâ€”including Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and  Columbia. Over a century later, ASOR has more than 90 consortium  institutions, including universities, seminaries, museums, foundations,  and libraries. In addition, we have more than 1,550 individual members.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">ASOR  communicates news of the latest research findings in our publications,  through lectures at the Annual Meeting, and our overseas institutes host  scholars working in the Middle East. ASOR's book series and journals,  such as Near Eastern Archaeology and the Bulletin of ASOR, are intended  for both a lay audience and specialist archaeologists, historians, and  Biblical scholars. ASOR's Annual Meeting brings together scholars from  around the world to present their latest findings and discuss their  research. Our independent overseas institutes in Cyprus, Israel, and  Jordan facilitate research in the field by students and scholars.  Fellowship programs are available to provide funds for work at these  institutes as well as for Mesopotamian studies and student travel to the  Annual Meeting.</span></div><br /><a href="https://soundcloud.com/asor-staff">See them all</a><br /><div style="text-align: center;">And See <a href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2014/02/asors-news-outlets.html">ASOR's News Outlets</a></div></blockquote></div>]]></content>
