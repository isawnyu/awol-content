    <title type="text">Digital publishing initiative for New World Archaeology</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[It's a big day for announcements of open access New World Archaeology
      initiatives. Variations of this press release are making the rounds of the mailing lists. The
      version quoted below is from the <a
      href="http://goldwaterlibrary.typepad.com/rgl/2009/04/university-of-arizona-press-to-join-five-other-presses-in---developing-digital-publishing-in-archaeology---the-andrew-w-mell.html">University
      of Arizona Press blog</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>The University Press
      of Colorado, Texas A&amp;M University Press, University of Alabama Press, University of
      Arizona Press, University Press of Florida and University of Utah Press will jointly explore
      ways to deliver data- and illustration-rich digital editions of cutting-edge archaeological
      research. The project, called the Archaeology of the Americas Digital Monograph Initiative,
      will give scholars and professional archaeologists the ability to review supplemental data not
      often contained in conventionally published volumes.<br /><br />“This initiative
      will push the boundaries of the scholarly monograph,” said Darrin Pratt, director of the
      University Press of Colorado. “To date, most digital publication has been the simple
      replication of print books in PDF or HTML format.”<br /><br />Enhanced by large
      data sets, color illustrations, video components, three-dimensional, rotatable images and, in
      some cases, interactive components such as reader commenting, the digital platform could
      “stretch our very conception of the book,” Pratt said.<br /><br />The University
      Press of Colorado will administer the planning grant, which will fund a shared project manager.
      If the program reaches full implementation, the presses could potentially create a third party
      entity devoted to the creation and maintenance of the digital platform. The presses also plan
      to work on a business model for the proposed platform.<br /><br />Meredith
      Morris-Babb, director of the University Press of Florida said development of a strong fiscal
      model is critical to the project's success.<br /><br />“Generating sustainable
      levels of revenue from digital publications has proved tricky for university presses,” she
      said.<br /><br />University of Arizona Press Editor-in-Chief Allyson Carter said
      the strength of the archaeology-focused digital initiative lies in the depth and breadth of the
      participating presses in New World archaeology.<br /><br />Together, the
      participating presses publish more than 70 titles in this field annually, focusing on the
      southeastern and southwestern United States, the Mountain West, Great Basin, Texas, Mexico,
      Central America, South America and the Caribbean as well as the early hunter-gatherers that
      peopled the Americas.<br /><br />The presses plan to develop a prototype digital
      book, providing a workable platform that could potentially be used by scholarly presses around
      the world. While the initiative will involve publishing many of the same books both in print
      and digital form, the participating presses will enhance digital editions with data not
      currently available in most printed books in the field.<br /><br />Like scholarly
      books in other humanities fields, sales of archaeology titles remain limited. Presses also must
      enforce strict length and image limitations to constrain production costs.<br /><br
      />“Many archaeologists have turned to supplementary CDs and personal Web sites as a place to
      post important context missing from their print work,” said Mary Lenn Dixon, editor-in-chief of
      Texas A&amp;M University Press. “We hope this initiative will help these authors reconnect
      that context to the arguments made in their books.”</blockquote>And see also the <a
