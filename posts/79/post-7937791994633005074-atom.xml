   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="site-title"><a href="https://crewsproject.wordpress.com/" rel="home">CREWS Project: Contexts of and Relations between Early Writing Systems</a></div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="site-title"><img alt="CREWS 8 cropped" class=" size-full wp-image-19 aligncenter" height="200" src="https://crewsproject.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/crews-8-cropped.png?w=840" width="154" /> </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="site-title"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Contexts of and Relations between Early Writing Systems</strong> (<strong>CREWS</strong>) is a European Research Council funded project hosted at the Faculty of Classics, Cambridge.</span></div><div class="site-title"><br /></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">The aim of the CREWS project is to take an innovative and  interdisciplinary approach to the history of writing, developing new  methodologies for studying writing systems and their social context. The  project researchers will be working on specific case studies relating  to inscriptions of the ancient Aegean, Eastern Mediterranean and Levant  (c.2000-600 BC). By looking at the ways in which writing systems were  developed and used, we can study not only the systems themselves and the  languages written in them, but also the cultural settings in which they  were adapted and maintained.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">By focusing on the Mediterranean in 2<sup>nd</sup> and 1<sup>st</sup> millennia BC, the project will be able to investigate writing during a  period when we know there were high levels of contact between different  areas. Against this backdrop of linguistic and cultural  interconnections, a study of how writing was passed on and adapted for  new uses has the potential to give new insights into social history.  Writing is more than just a vessel for recording language: it is a tool  that is shaped by and contributes to the society in which it exists.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">For an introduction to the concepts underpinning the project see the welcome post <a href="https://crewsproject.wordpress.com/2016/04/03/welcome-to-crews/" target="_blank">here.</a></span></blockquote><div class="site-title"><br /></div>]]></content>
