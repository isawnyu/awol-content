    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.lascivaroma.com/">Lascivia Roma Crowdsourcing
      Project</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Find names of persons and places next to a member of the Latin semantic field of
      sexuality, annotate and lemmatize them, and tell us about their relationship with the
      member.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><b>Available for annotation:</b> 505 Sentences, 11 Words of the
      semantic field of Sexuality, 1012 Identified forms, 874 Potential Entities.
      </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Understanding the sense of a word is a complicated task, especially in ancient
      languages, where the meaning of such words has been lost over the centuries and only a vague or
      ambiguous remaining sense is still known. Some of these words, such as lasciuus, a, um, appear
      to have had their meanings twisted in French translations (« enjoué, gai, pétulant, etc. ») as
      well as in English translations (petulant, sportive, playful in Lewis &amp; Short on
      Perseus.tufts.edu). But its large use and context in Martial's Epigrammata drove us to think
      that its meaning has, after centuries of -perhaps- too much decency and propriety in
      translations, faded away. This is why we decided to create a way to collect more information
      about it and its companion in the lexical field of sexuality.</span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">For this purpose, we designed Lasciva Roma. It will not only give us informations
      about lascivus, a, um but also on the semantic field of Sexuality and its context. It is by far
      the largest collection of data around this topic, driven by you.</span>
      </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Lasciva Roma is built on the Clotho project.</span>
      </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The
      Clotho project comprises two tools. The first one is based on python software, which enables
      the distant reading of the corpus and the export of its results. The other is a PHP platform
      which enables a team or a crowd to annotate and clean the results. Both are relatively easy to
      install and fully Open Source so new functionalities of wide application can be added.
