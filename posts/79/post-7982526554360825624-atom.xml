      2015]</span></div><br />The history of travel, travelers, and travel writing
      is an academic discipline in it's own right. Travelers accounts of journeys from before <a
      href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=paus.+1.1.1">Pausanius</a> to
      the present form an important corpus of descriptive documentation of ancient monuments and
      sites, many of them no longer visible. <a
      href="http://www.travellersinegypt.org/archives/2005/01/astene.html">ASTENE: The Association
      for the Study of Travel in Egypt and the Near East</a> organizes conferences and
      publishes a <a href="http://www.astene.org.uk/bulletins/bulletins.htm">Bulletin</a>
      devoted to the topic.&nbsp; The venerable <a href="http://www.hakluyt.com/">Hakluyt
      Society</a> has been the focus of publication of scholarly editions of primary records of
      voyages, travels and other geographical material since 1846. Shirley Weber's compendious
      bibliography <i><a href="http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001240769">Voyages
      and travels in Greece, the Near East, and adjacent regions, made previous to the year 1801;
      being a part of a larger catalogue of works on geography, cartography, voyages and travels, in
      the Gennadius Library in Athens</a></i> has been available online for some time
      (though) it has been brought to my attention that it in no longer open access).<br
      /><br />The discipline seems to be an attractive one for the development of open
      access digital libraries.&nbsp; <br /><ul><li><a
