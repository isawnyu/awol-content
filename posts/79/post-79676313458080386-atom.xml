   <title type="text">Administrative: Happy New Year</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[As the new year begins and the seventh anniversary of the establishment of AWOL approaches (on 6th January), I'd like to take a moment to thank those of you who have contributed links to open access scholarship on the ancient world, or who have contributed in other ways. I look forward to continuing feedback from users on how AWOL might be improved or changed.&nbsp; You may contact me via the comment function that is at the bottom of each page, or directly via social media, email (cejo  at uchicago dot edu) or even by post.<br /><br />It seems worthy of note that as a moment ago AWOL had received 5,737,798 page  views. 3,737,798 of these have been within the last three years. Traffic in December 2016 fell just short of 200,000 page views as did two of the summer month in 2016. I am at a loss to explain these outliers. "Normal" traffic hovers around the 100,000 page views per month level.<br /><br />In the right hand side bar of AWOL is a form allowing you to receive  notifications of updates to AWOL by email. This seems useful for those  for whom news feeds are not. Your address will be safe. Neither AWOL nor  feedburner will send spam. Since I announced this feature in June 2009,  <span id="subscriberSum">7,796</span> e-mail addresses have subscribed to AWOL.<br /><br />If you are reading this in a newsreader or on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AncientWorldOnline">facebook </a>or <a href="http://awol_tweets/">twitter </a>(or  other social media) you will have to click through to see the form in  the sidebar.  If you are reading this by email you have already done  what's required.  The software requires a confirmation of your request  to join. If you don't see such a confirmation request, check your spam  folder.<br /><br />Instructions for unsubscribing from the email list are at the bottom of each message from AWOL. <br /><br />If you are not reading this on on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AncientWorldOnline">facebook </a>or <a href="http://awol_tweets/">twitter</a> you are welcome to join in there.<br /><br />You are invited to visit <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/publications/awol-index/"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The AWOL Index</span></a><br />         <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"> <span style="font-size: xx-small;">This publication systematically describes ancient-world information resources on the             world-wide web.
