Farming then spread westwards through Europe over the subsequent  millennia, arriving in the far west and north of the continent by  c.6,000 cal BP. For decades there have been major debates as to the  nature of this spread, with many basic questions still remaining largely  unanswered.</span><br />   <span style="font-size: x-small;">The objective of this major research project, which was funded for  four years by the AHRC from January 2007, was to address these  questions. The largest and most systematic survey of published/archived  archaeological zooarchaeological data ever undertaken has been carried  out in order to re-examine the evidence for the origins of stock-keeping  in the Near East and its spread into Europe during the Epipalaeolithic  and Neolithic periods, c.12,000 to 6,000 cal BP.</span><br />    <span style="font-size: x-small;">The aims of the project were to establish the most significant  characteristics of early Neolithic animal exploitation economies through  time and over broad and geographic regions, and specifically to</span><br />    <ul><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">understand the key factors that account for variation in early Neolithic animal exploitation</span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">explore possible variations in husbandry and hunting strategies  that developed as Neolithic herding economies spread from their area/s  of origin</span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">assess the speed of spread of livestock farming across Europe</span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">look for possible adaptive changes in husbandry and hunting practices</span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">investigate the evidence for local indigenous domestication</span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">compare the zooarchaeological data with archaeobotanical evidence  on the origins and spread of Neolithic crops and farming (e.g.,  including the results of a previous AHRC funded project based at the IoA  led by Stephen Shennan on <a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/neoplants_ahrb_2005/">The origin and spread of Neolithic plant economies in the Near East and Europe</a>) to assess similarities/differences in the spread of crop and livestock 'packages' throughout Europe.</span></li></ul><span style="font-size: x-small;">The basis for the study is a comprehensive database of selected  animal bone data from relevant sites. The database includes c.650 site  records (comprising over 950 different phases) and c.13,500 faunal  records of approximately 600 different taxa. All the zooarchaeological  data are spatially and chronologically referenced.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">                                                        <br /><ul class="dlMenu"><li>  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/stock_ahrc_2012/index.cfm">Introduction</a> </span></li><li>  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/stock_ahrc_2012/overview.cfm">Overview</a></span> </li><li>     <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/stock_ahrc_2012/downloads.cfm">Downloads</a></span>  </li><li>   <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/stock_ahrc_2012/metadata.cfm">Metadata</a></span>  </li><li>   <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/stock_ahrc_2012/stats.cfm">Usage Statistics</a></span>  </li></ul></blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">&nbsp;</span></div><div id="archiveheader"><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div>]]></content>
