    <title type="text">New Closed Access Journal: Facts of Life</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a
      href="http://fragments-of-truth.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/academic-publisher-unveils-new-journal.html"><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Facts of Life</span></a><br /><blockquote
      class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Unlike previous closed access journals
      in which articles are hidden behind a paywall and can be accessed after paying a fee,
      "<i>Facts of Life</i>" guarantees that nobody other than the author can access the
      published article. This allows scientists to include the article as a published paper on their
      CV and cite their work, without ever having&nbsp;to worry that someone else might read the
      article. Beer expects that this new concept will be embraced by many researchers<br
      /><br />The physician-scientist and poet Yuri Zhivago is among the first researchers
      to submit manuscripts to the new journal. "It is a blessing to have this journal", Zhivago
      commented, "I have at least three manuscripts that contain experiments that cannot be
      replicated. &nbsp;Now I can publish them without having to worry about my tenure committee
      criticizing me for having too few publications. If I published them in an open access journal,
      I would eventually have to retract the papers and this would could damage my reputation as a
      researcher. By publishing in "<i>Facts of Life"</i>, I can be sure that nobody will
      ever be able to accuse me of publishing fraudulent data."<br /><br />Beer is
      confident that there are many other Zhivagos out there who need a completely closed-access
      journal. "We are taking closed access publishing to a new level and we think that we provide a
      much-needed forum for all the researchers want to publish but have no sound data." She is
      convinced that other publishers will follow suit when they see the success of the "completely
      closed access" model. &nbsp;&nbsp; </span></blockquote>]]></content>
