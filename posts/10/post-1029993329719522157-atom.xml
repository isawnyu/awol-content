      class="entry-content"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>Second of four Getty
      Vocabularies now available for free download; two more to follow within a
      year</b></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img

      /></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">We’re delighted to
      announce that the Getty Research Institute has released the <a
      href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/" target="_blank">Getty Thesaurus
      of Geographic Names (TGN)<sup>®</sup></a> as Linked Open Data. This
      represents an important step in the Getty’s ongoing work to make our knowledge resources freely
      available to all.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Following the
      release of the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)<sup>®</sup> in February,
      TGN is now the second of the four Getty vocabularies to be made entirely free to download,
      share, and modify. Both data sets are available for download at <b><a
      href="http://vocab.getty.edu/" target="_blank">vocab.getty.edu</a></b> under an
      Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC BY 1.0).</span><br /><h3><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">What Is TGN?</span></h3><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">The Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names is a resource of over 2,000,000 names of
      current and historical places, including cities, archaeological sites, nations, and physical
      features. It focuses mainly on places relevant to art, architecture, archaeology, art
      conservation, and related fields.</span><br /><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">TGN is powerful for humanities research because of its linkages to the three other
      <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/" target="_blank">Getty
      vocabularies</a>—the Union List of Artist Names, the Art &amp; Architecture
      Thesaurus, and the Cultural Objects Name Authority. Together the vocabularies provide a suite
      of research resources covering a vast range of places, makers, objects, and artistic concepts.
      The work of three decades, the Getty vocabularies are living resources that continue to grow
      and improve.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Because they serve
      as standard references for cataloguing, the Getty vocabularies are also the conduits through
      which data published by museums, archives, libraries, and other cultural institutions can find
      and connect to each other.</span><br /><h3><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">Why Linked Open Data?</span></h3><span style="font-size:
      x-small;"><a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/lod/"><img
      alt="Linked Open Data - The Getty Vocabularies" class="alignright size-full wp-image-17040"
      src="http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/files/2014/02/lod_getty_logo.png" height="120" title="Linked
      Open Data - The Getty Vocabularies" width="250" /></a>When data is linked and open, it
      is structured and published in ways that allow it to be recombined with data from other sources
      to create new knowledge. In other words, Linked Open Data connects information from diverse
      publishers and areas of scholarship, enabling the dramatic expansion and acceleration of
      research.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">When the vast trove
      of data in the Getty vocabularies is released into the Linked Open Data ecosystem, researchers
      will not only be able to retrieve more complete data, but hone it to their precise requests. In
      short, they can ask, and answer, ever more complex queries.</span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">What artists were working in Venice in the 1520s? When, where,
      and under whose patronage were Buddhist temples built in India? What museums or libraries
      currently own folios from a disassembled 14<sup>th</sup>-century medieval Psalter?
      What&nbsp;was the iconography of the illuminations&nbsp;in this Psalter? Today these
      questions are time-consuming and difficult to answer. In the world of Linked Open Data, they
      could be just a few clicks away.</span><br /><h3><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">A Rich Data Ecosystem</span></h3><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">To show how Linked Open Data from TGN can enhance research, let’s take the single
      example of <a
      href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=ellora&amp;place=&amp;nation=&amp;prev_page=1&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=1075244"
      target="_blank">Ellora Caves in Maharashtra, India</a>, a UNESCO World Heritage Site
      famed for its astonishing rock-cut architecture. TGN contains not only the caves’ location but
      also their geographical hierarchy, variant names in multiple languages, and the religious
      traditions represented there. Now imagine that this data is linked to other data—such as maps,
      books and articles, and photographs depicting this location. A vast trove of interrelated
      resources, currently only findable individually through manual search using variant spellings,
      becomes click away.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Within the
      Getty alone, in a future Linked Open Data world multiple resources could be interlinked: a
      <a
      href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/digital_collections/notable/hindu_excavations.html"
      target="_blank">digitized volume from the early 1800s</a> from the special collections
      of the Getty Research Institute; art historically significant <a
      href="http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/247175/lala-deen-dayal-figures-in-ellora-caves-indian/"
      target="_blank">early photographs of the site</a> by English, French, and Indian
      photographers in the collection of the Getty Museum; and multiple publications from the Getty
      Conservation Institute including an <a
      href="http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/9_1/profile1.html"
      target="_blank">update on conservation efforts</a>.</span><br
      /><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Next Steps and
      Feedback</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">All four Getty
      vocabularies will be released as Linked Open Data by late 2015. To follow the progress of the
      project at the Getty Research Institute, see our <a
      href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/lod/index.html"
      target="_blank">Linked Open Data page</a>.</span><br /><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">We’re grateful to members of the digital humanities community
      who have taken the time to make suggestions or to let us know how they are making use of Art
      &amp; Architecture Thesaurus data released in February. We welcome the continued comments
      and input of the user community; if you have a suggestion or find the Getty’s Linked Open Data
      useful in your own work, please share it here or email the Getty’s Linked Open Data team at
