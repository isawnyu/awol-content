      class="bigblue"><blockquote> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The web
      presentation of the AIIS photographic archive is a joint venture of the AIIS and the Digital
      South Asia Library project. The data included been collected and edited by AIIS staff in
      Gurgaon. Programming and database design have been undertaken by DSAL project staff in
      Chicago.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">The original AIIS collection is organized into four separate collections,
      architecture, sculpture, paintings and numismatics. The web version of the AIIS photograph
      archive has combined these four collections into one for ease of searching and display. There
      is an option to limit a search to one or more of these original
      designations.</span></blockquote><blockquote> <blockquote><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">The <b>architectural</b> database model is designed
      to provide specific information about an architectural monument: structural details, decorative
      motifs, technical details, materials, etc. Any monument, structural or rock-cut, that possesses
      describable architectural features should be analyzed according to fields in this database
      model. In addition, sculptural and painted details in situ should be described along with the
      monument itself, using the same architecture model. Rock-cut monuments containing elements that
      can be described in architectural, sculptural, and painting terms also should be indexed using
      the architecture model.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">The <b>sculpture</b> database model is designed to
      provide detailed analysis of detached round and relief sculpture. The kinds of information
      contained in the sculpture database model include descriptions of the subjects and
      iconographical features (attributes, mudras, asanas, and subordinate elements). Detached
      sculpture from a known monument but now in a public or private collection should be analyzed
      using the sculpture model. In addition, sculpture lying loose at a site which does not
      necessarily belong to a monument located at the site also should be analyzed according to the
      sculpture model. In this latter case, the location should be noted in the PRESENT LOCATION
      field.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">The <b>painting</b> database model includes specific fields for
      analysis of paintings and illustrated folios of manuscripts. Wall paintings (murals and
      frescoes) that have been removed to public or private collections should be described using the
      painting model. However, wall paintings in situ (such as those at Ajanta) should be described
      with the monument where they are located using the architectural
      model.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">The <b>numismatic</b> database model is designed to accommodate
      specific information about coins.
      </span></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">The structure of the various databases is rather similar, many of the fields are
      in all four databases. For the web implemnation we have grouped the following fields together
      for searching purposes. </span></blockquote><blockquote>
      <blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">A <b>subject</b> search
      will look through data in the following fields: monument, religious affiliation, style, period,
      patron, index category, subject, context, materials, monument type, medium.
      </span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">A
      <b>location</b> search will look through data in the following fields: country,
      state, district, site, monument, complex, present location.
      </span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">A
      <b>date</b> search will look through data in the following fields: photo date, AIIS
      period, CE date. </span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">An <b>identification number</b> search will look through data in the
      following fields: accession number, negative number, museum
      number.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">An <b>affliation</b> search will look through data in the following
      fields: documentation reference, photographer, protected by, donor, religious affiliation,
      patron.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size:
      x-small;">The quick search will look through data in the following fields: monument,
      religious affiliation, style, period, patron, index category, subject, context, materials,
      monument type, medium, country, state, district, site, monument, complex, present
      location.</span></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><span
      style="font-size: x-small;">All of the information included in this database originally was
      written on individual index cards. The herculean task of entering the data from the index cards
      into a database was done by staff at the AIIS offices in Gurgaon under the careful direction of
      Sushil Sharma. </span></blockquote></div>]]></content>
