   <title type="text">Holbo, John, and Belle Waring.  Reason &amp; persuasion: three dialogues by Plato : Euthyphro, Meno, Republic book 1.</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[Holbo, John, and Belle Waring.<i>&nbsp;</i> <a href="http://www.reasonandpersuasion.com/"><i>Reason &amp; persuasion: three dialogues by Plato : Euthyphro, Meno, Republic book 1</i></a>. Singapore: Prentice Hall.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img src="http://examinedlife.typepad.com/reasonandpersuasionbook/ornamentwidemargins4.png/" /> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>Reason and Persuasion</em> contains three Plato dialogues -  Euthyphro, Meno, Republic Book I - translated by Belle Waring; with  extensive commentary and illustrations by John Holbo. It is suitable as  an introductory textbook but we hope more advanced students of  philosophy and Plato will get something out of it as well. The 4th  edition is substantially revised and improved.<br /><br /> "There is no dearth of textbooks offering an introduction to Plato's  thought, but Holbo's stands apart in the scope of its introductory  material and its user-friendly style ... The colloquial yet accurate  translation by Belle Waring serves to reduce the distance between the  student and the world of the dialogues still further ...Holbo's  commentaries on these three dialogues serve to situate them both as  individual works and also as parts of Plato's overall project of showing  the problems of persuasion divorced from reason. Rather than taking a  strictly scholarly approach the author has made clear the relevance of  these texts for questions even non-philosophers should find worth  asking. For instructors seeking an introductory text for first time  readers of Plato, Holbo's book is worthy of consideration."<br /><a href="https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24249-reason-and-persuasion-three-dialogues-by-plato-euthyphro-meno-republic-book-i/">Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</a>, review of the 3rd edition.</span></blockquote>]]></content>
