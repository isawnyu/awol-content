It began in 2009 — and continues today —&nbsp;as a  collaborative effort to collect and share free, open-access images of  archaeological sites, landscapes, and artifacts. This academic year we  are working on two new initiatives that will enrich AWIB's content and  improve access to it.</span><br /> <h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Digitizing the 35mm slides of Emily and Cornelius Vermeule</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Among the treasures of the </span><a class="internal-link" href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/library">ISAW library</a><span> are over 2,000 volumes that constitute The Collection of </span><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Vermeule">Emily</a><span> and </span><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Clarkson_Vermeule_III">Cornelius Vermeule</a><span>.  The generous gift of Cornelius Vermeule to the Institute, this  collection includes a number of rare editions of works on classical  archaeology and philology, as well as many difficult-to-find books  acquired on research trips abroad by the collectors. In addition to the  books, the gift included pamphlets, offprints, and 43 metal boxes  containing 35mm slides, most of which appear to have been original  creations, rather than purchased sets. We estimate the total number of  slides at around 3,200. Most of these boxes appear to have been  organized for lectures, and are accompanied by varying degrees of  documentation.</span></span><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The AWIB team, in collaboration with Library staff, is currently  conducting an inventory of these slides, with the objective of  distinguishing between those that are original photography of objects or  sites, and those that were shot from plates in books or other published  sources. Once the inventory is complete, the original photography will  be scanned and copies of these images, complete with as much descriptive  information as can be collected, will be added to the contents of AWIB.  Iris Fernandez, the AWIB Managing Editor, is carrying out this work  with the assistance of an academic intern, Emmanuel Aprilakis, a  Classics major from <a class="external-link" href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/main/">Hunter College</a>.</span><br /> <h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Upgrading for access and preservation</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">We are also retooling the technology that underpins AWIB in order to:</span><br /> <ol><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>improve our ability to publish images to the </span><a class="external-link" href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/">ISAW Photostream on the Flickr.com photo-sharing website</a><span>,</span></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>establish a purpose-built website for all AWIB imagery, and </span></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>automate the deposit of all our content in the </span><a class="external-link" href="https://archive.nyu.edu/">NYU Faculty Digital Archive</a><span> (FDA).</span></span></li></ol><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span><br />Iris and Emmanuel are joined in this work by ISAW's Associate Director for Digital Programs, </span><a class="internal-link" href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/people/staff/tom-elliott">Tom Elliott</a><span>, and by Ronak Parpani, a Master's student in Computer Science at </span><a class="external-link" href="https://www.cims.nyu.edu/">NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a><span>.</span></span><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">Our new software for uploading images to Flickr will take full advantage of the service's <a class="external-link" href="https://secure.flickr.com/services/apps/about/">application programming interface</a>, improving the quality of the imagery and descriptive information we can upload and making the process easier and faster.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The new "native" website for AWIB is being built with the open-source <a class="external-link" href="http://omeka.org/">Omeka content management system</a>, developed by the <a class="external-link" href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/">Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media</a> at George Mason University. It will provide more nuanced display and  search of our descriptive information than Flickr provides, and will  also give us an environment we can customize in the future to better  integrate AWIB content with our other <a class="internal-link" href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/online-resources">online resources</a>.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">Depositing copies of AWIB imagery and descriptive data in the Faculty  Digital Archive will help protect AWIB from degradation or catastrophe  for the long haul. Operated by NYU's library system, the FDA keeps  multiple digital copies of each deposit in geographically separated  locations and constantly performs automated testing to ensure that those  copies remain complete and unchanged.</span><br /> <h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Impact and participation</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">This year's work, supported by the <a class="external-link" href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/director">Director's</a> Projects and Grants Fund, will not only expand the content and features of the <i>Ancient World Image Bank</i>,  but also establish it as a mature system to support the entire ISAW  community in collecting and disseminating imagery for teaching,  research, and scholarly communication.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">Readers interested in contributing their own original imagery to AWIB may contact the Managing Editor via <a class="mail-link" href="mailto:isaw.awib@nyu.edu?subject=inquiry%20about%20donating%20images">isaw.awib@nyu.edu</a>. Those interested in providing financial support to the project may contact Tom Elliott at <a class="mail-link" href="mailto:tom.elliott@nyu.edu?subject=inquiry%20about%20supporting%20the%20Ancient%20World%20Image%20Bank">tom.elliott@nyu.edu</a> or make a contribution to the ISAW Digital Programs Fund via one of the mechanisms described on the <a class="internal-link" href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/support-isaw-1/giving-to-isaw">Giving to ISAW page</a>.</span></blockquote></div></div></div>]]></content>
