      entitled their study of Sasanian taxation Finanzgeschichte der Spätantike in 1957. However the
      latter was only about Sasanian Iran and not a general treatment of finance in Late Antiquity
      that included the Sasanians. ... <a class="more-link"

      Christianity in the early fourth century was soon translated into Greek and other languages:
      Arabic, Old Russian, and Georgian. There also exist shorter re¬cen¬sions (known as The Life of
      St. Gregory) in Karshuni, Ethio‐pian, Coptic, Greek, Georgian, Latin, and Arabic. The Greek
      version of the History is extant in nine manuscripts dating from the 8th‐12th cc. Only one of
      them, kept in the Laurentian library of Florence, Plut. VII, cod. Gr. 25 (12th c.), contains
      nine initial para‐graphs absent from the Armenian original and from the other recensions. ...

      impression of Iran upon all aspects of early mediaeval Armenia has long been recognized.
      Although linguists may have taken the lead in tracing this influence, scholars in all
      disciplines, particularly historians and theologians, have unearthed multiple parallels and
      connections between the two cultures. The penetrating studies by Garsoïan and Russell over the
      past four decades have proved to be particularly influential, to the extent that no scholar
      today would seriously contemplate studying early mediaeval Armenia without acknowledging its
      Iranian heritage.1 Indeed such is the degree of unanimity over the level of Iranian influence
      upon all aspects of Armenian society and culture that the contention has begun to operate in
      the opposite direction. Armenian sources have been exploited to shed light upon Iranian, and
      specifically Sasanian, history. ... <a class="more-link"

      have had a chance to see a unique gold coin of Shapur I. Unfortunately the location of this
      coin today is unknown to us. At first sight, the coin looks like the usual issues of Shapur I
      (particularly the iconography in obverse), but exploration of some details in reverse give us
      cause to suppose that it was minted for a certain occasion. Shapur I continued the regional
      policy of his predecessor, Artashir I, from the beginning of his reign. A series of victories
      against the Roman Empire opened the way to conquer Armenia, which was the main success of
      Sasanian Iran in the West. Shapur I represented his glorious victories against Roman Empire in
      rock sculpture and took a new title, king of kings Iran and non‐Iran, as a result of his
      successful policy. ... <a class="more-link"

      afterwards that of her sister Āzarmīgduxt, although short‐lived, were historically significant.
      No other woman ascended the Sasanian throne, in her own rights, before or after them. The
      significance is even greater in view of the social and cultural limitations placed on women in
      Sasanian Iran, as discussed in the studies presented by scholars such as Jamsheed K. Choksy,
      Albert De Jong, and Mansour Shaki. This paper investigates the factors that legitimized the
      rise of these women to the throne through the examination of the ideas of Iranian kingship in
      general and Sasanian imperial ideology in particular. ... <a class="more-link"

      existence which explore the Sasanian historical geography. The pioneering work of Marquart on
      the historical geography of the Sasanian Empire in the book of Ps.- Moses of Chorene is one of
      the earliest studies of its kind. Later discoveries of numismatic and sigillographic finds, as
      well as publications on and editions of literary and material evidence, relevant to the
      historical geography and administrative organization of the Sasanian Empire did not change
      things dramatically, but did help to complete and in some cases correct early impressions.
      During the last decades R. Gyselen and Ph. Gignoux have significantly contributed to the field
      of Sasanian historical and administrative geography through their publications and scrutiny of
      the sigillographic, numismatic and written sources. ... <a class="more-link"

      Quarter,” another from the kust ī xwarāsān “Northeastern Quarter,” and a unique, mostly
      illegible and unpublished bulla among the collection as well. Before dealing with the Barakat

      discoveries – which are, however mainly fortuitous ones – the archaeology of pre-Islamic Iran
      is still badly known. This is particularly true for the Sasanian period (224-651), a kind of
      “golden age” for Persian art and culture that is remembered in later Islamic sources as the
      apogee of the Persian Empire. It is a well-known fact that written sources are practically
      absent in pre-Islamic Iran if one excludes official inscriptions in Pahlavi on rock reliefs and
      the coinage. For this reason, the archaeological investigation should have an important role in
      the reconstruction of the Sasanian past. ... <a class="more-link"

      the Middle Persian dād although the meaning of dād is more complex than the Western concept of
      law. In fact, several texts attest to the dual meaning of dād as both law and religion,
      sometimes understood as a religious law, sometimes as a synonym of religion, sometimes as a
      secular law or the king’s command. It is only the context of the text which is helpful to
      decide which meaning was referred to. In the Pahlawi Riwāyat Accompanying the Dādestān ī Dēnīg
      dād has the dual meaning of religion and law: ’when someone goes over from the (religious) law
      to which he belongs to another law he is margarzān, because he is deserting the Good Religion,
      and he is taking up this bad law’. ... <a class="more-link"

      a numismatist can isolate a coin type that provides evidence about a particular political
      situation, whose real nature has to be discovered by the historian. We show first how, from a
      corpus of more or less representative coinage (A), the numismatic scholar can identify a series
      of coinage (B). If the scholar believes that the series has a sufficient number of typological
      and stylistic characteristics that distinguish it from general coinage production, he/she will
      attribute it to a specific source, that is, to a specific mint (C1). ... <a

      first is probably the most interesting in Sasanian history. The chaos caused by Mazdakism
      during his reign lead to a restored, strong, monarchy under his son and successor. Kavad I had
      two reigns, 488 to 496 and 499 to 531 AD. He succeeded Valkash (484-488) but was soon deposed
      by his brother Zamasp (496-499). Three years in exile Kavad recovered his throne and was
      eventually succeeded by his son, one of the most remarkable Sasanian kings, Khusro I (531-579).
      Kavad had numerous coin types. The one that interests us here is his first type. It was used
      during his first reign, showing no date, and was then used during the first two years of his
      second reign, being known for years 11 and 12. A new type was introduced in year 13. ... <a

      important objects in understanding the economic and administrative history Ērānšahr. The bulla
      which is a seal impression onto clay was used as a signatory device for commodities and
      letters. Until now a large number of collections from both museums and private collectors have
      been published, and with each publication our knowledge of economic, social and administrative
      history of Ērānšahr deepens. The collection under study here provide further evidence to
      different localities, some known and others of unknown provenance. However, these collections
      provide a microcosm of economic history of several provinces of the Iranian Plateau. By
      studying these collections one is able to gather detailed information on the administrative
      function of the specific Zoroastrian priests, religious endowments, accountants and other
      personalities who were traders and businessmen. ... <a class="more-link"

      manumission, sales receipts, tax-lists, and letters regarding commercial matters. These have
      been found, since 1990, in various markets in northern Pakistan and have found their way into
      the collections of antique dealers in Europe. The vast majority of the documents are now in
      possession of Dr. David Naser Khalili of London, with a few pieces in the collection of antique
      dealers in Europe and the Middle East. With the exception of a few, the documents are written
      on leather, both tanned and un-tanned. ... <a class="more-link"

      diverse population and beliefs. Today, Christians, Muslims, Jews, and Yazidis live in cities
      and villages in the valleys and gorges of the region. One religion that had a strong impact on
      ancient Armenia, Georgia, and the Republic of Azerbijan was Zoroastrianism. While the sources
      and views of Zoroastrianism are mainly from its homeland, Iran, Zoroastrianism also flourished
      in the Caucasus in conjunction with the local, native religions of the region. Kartveli or
      Georgia was converted to Christianity in the fourth century CE. The traditional date given for
      this momentous event in the history of Georgia is 337 CE. According to Christian sources, King
      Mirian (Mihran) converted from “paganism,” but a closer look at the sources suggests that the
      king and the people of ancient Georgia were worshipers of Ohrmazd (Ahura Mazda). ... <a
