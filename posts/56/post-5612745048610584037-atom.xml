    <title type="text">EThOS - Electronic Theses Online Service</title>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://ethos.bl.uk/Home.do">EThOS - Electronic Theses Online
      Service</a> (beta)<br /><br /><blockquote>The aim of EThOS is:<br
      /><br /> * To offer a 'single point of access' where researchers the world over can
      access ALL theses produced by UK Higher Education<br /> * To support Higher Education
      Institutions through the transition from print to e-theses<br /> * To help UK Higher
      Education Institutions expand available content by digitising paper theses<br /> * To
      demonstrate the quality of UK research and help attract students and research investment into
      UK HE<br /><br />To achieve this, EThOS offers a coherent and consistent interface
      by implementing a central 'hub' comprising an e-store and a digitisation suite at The British
      Library site in Boston Spa, Yorkshire. The hub automatically harvests e-theses from
      Institutional Repositories and digitises paper theses from participating institutions to offer
      the single point of access..<br /><br />Many UK institutions support Open Access to
      their theses, so download of their digital and digitised theses is free to the researcher. A
      small number of participating institutions may not be able to offer Open Access and in this
      case the researcher may have to pay for the digitisation.<br /><br />Where a thesis
      must be digitised before supply, you can expect a short delay. However, you will be informed
      when the thesis is ready for collection and you can then log on to the system and download
      it.<br /><br />EThOS can only offer the theses of participating institutions. While
      we expect a large number of institutions to take part, we cannot supply from an institutions
      which chooses not to. In this case, you should approach the institution's library directly to
      gain access to a thesis</blockquote>A search of the keyword "ancient", limited to items
      available for immediate download, yields a findset of thirty-nine dissertations, mostly in
      Classics, Mediterranean Archaeology and Egyptology. Other keywords will get you equally
      interesting findsets, and the collection is growing.]]></content>
