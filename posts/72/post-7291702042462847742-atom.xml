   <title type="text">The Sir Arthur Evans Archive</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: xx-small;">[First posted in AWOL 19 May 2014, updated 16 November 2016]</span><br /><br /><a href="http://sirarthurevans.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/">The Sir Arthur Evans Archive</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://sirarthurevans.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/images/Banner4.jpg" class="decoded" src="http://sirarthurevans.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/images/Banner4.jpg" height="37" width="400" />&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">This website is based on the first overview catalogue of the Sir  Arthur Evans and Knossos archives prepared by Dr&nbsp;Yannis&nbsp;Galanakis in  March 2012. This material is one of the most important resources of the  Department of Antiquities at the Ashmolean Museum. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Son of the great prehistorian Sir John Evans, Arthur (1851-1941) made  a career of his own both at the Ashmolean, where he served as Keeper  for 25 years (1884-1908), and in Crete, where with his discoveries at  Knossos he added a new chapter to the history of the Mediterranean. The  archive contains all the documentation pertaining to Evans's excavations  at Knossos, including his archaeological research in the Aegean, the  Mediterranean and Europe. It is the largest, most complete, and  comprehensive archive of its kind from this early era of archaeological  exploration. The non-Knossos material, occupying about 30% of the total,  relates to Evans's political activism, his life and work in Oxford, his  scientific network (especially his involvement in various committees  and the British Association for the Advancement of Science) and aspects  of his personal life. An important part of the archive comprises related  archives of people personally or professionally associated with Evans;  such as his half-sister, Dame Joan Evans, his Knossos architect and  artist Piet de Jong, the architects Theodore Fyfe and Christian Doll,  and his field archaeologist, Duncan Mackenzie. The archive also contains  the original explanatory panels used in the 1936 'Minoan Room' (part of  the exhibition organised at the Royal Academy of Arts to commemorate  the fiftieth anniversary of the British School at Athens). </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Until now several lists and catalogues existed in the Department of  Antiquities thanks to the indefatigable and painstaking work of a number  of scholars, including the late Ann Brown, Dr Nicoletta Momigliano, and  Dr Susan Sherratt. Yet no coherent single overview catalogue was  available for this material to give some general direction both to the  personnel of the Department and anyone interested in researching and  accessing this significant resource. The overview catalogue fills in  this important gap and provides general guidance to those researching  and working with the Sir Arthur Evans Archive. As its title states, it  offers an 'overview' rather than a detailed description of the archive's  holdings to item level. Nevertheless, this useful exercise allowed us  to identify more thoroughly and consistently the work that has already  been carried out and the work that still needs to be done in order to  complete the cataloguing of this major resource to item level. More  importantly, it has helped the museum identify curatorial, research,  conservation, and digitization priorities with regard to the Sir Arthur  Evans archive.</span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Given the importance of Knossos in world archaeology, the Ashmolean  will continue its efforts to conserve, preserve and digitize Sir Arthur  Evans's archive in order to make it one day accessible online. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>Scope and Structure</b>: </span><br /><ol type="A"><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://sirarthurevans.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/archive/papers">Papers</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://sirarthurevans.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/archive/notebooks">Notebooks, diaries, pocketbooks and sketchbooks</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://sirarthurevans.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/archive/photography">Photographs</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://sirarthurevans.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/archive/drawings">Drawings</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://sirarthurevans.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/archive/newspapers">Newspaper and press cuttings</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://sirarthurevans.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/archive/scripta"><i>Scripta Minoa</i></a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://sirarthurevans.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/archive/otherarc">Other archives </a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://sirarthurevans.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/archive/exhibitions">Major exhibitions</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://sirarthurevans.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/archive/books">Books and offprints</a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://sirarthurevans.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/archive/otherreps">Other Repositories</a></span></li></ol></blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="generalBodyMBoxMenu"></div></blockquote>]]></content>
