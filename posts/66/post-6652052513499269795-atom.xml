   <title type="text">Handlist of British Library papyri acquired since 1956</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.academia.edu/14491263/Handlist_of_British_Library_papyri_acquired_since_1956"><span itemprop="name">Handlist of British Library papyri acquired since 1956</span></a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span itemprop="name">Details of newly-acquired papyri were historically recorded in the Catalogue of Additions published at periodic intervals over the years. The existing Catalogue of Additions series only includes papyri acquired before 1956. It had been intended to detail the later acquisitions in a future volume of the Catalogue of Additions, but as these are no longer published, the papyri (Papyrus 2923-3136, and Egerton Papyrus 37) have not been as widely known as they perhaps might be. In an effort to bring them to greater attention, we have compiled a short Register of Papyri Acquired since 1956, which can be downloaded as an Excel document. This gives details of British Library inventory number, details of publication where that is known, a Trismegistos number if extant, notes of any other papyri that originally formed part of the same document or book, source and date of acqusition, and a brief description of contents.</span></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span itemprop="name"><br />Only one item has been digitised, Papyrus 3053 (P. Oxy. 2470), but all these papyri would be included in any future digitisation project.</span></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span itemprop="name"><br />The bulk of the acquisitions are known to scholars, forming a large portion of the Hibeh Papyri (Papyrus 2943-3035), Volume 27 of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri (Papyrus 3036-3063), and many of the Michaelides papyri (Papyrus 3100-3132), though not all of the latter have been edited. In addition, other acquisitions, or items incorporated from “limbo” or transferred from other departments in the British Museum or British Library, are mostly fragmentary, but would certainly benefit from further study.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span itemprop="name"></span><br /><span itemprop="name">We are not aware of any current research being carried out on the items in this list, but always welcome details of editions, and offprints, where possible, which can be sent in the first instance to the Manuscripts and Maps Reference Team (<a href="http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/inrrooms/stp/refteam/refteam/refcontacts.html">http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/inrrooms/stp/refteam/refteam/refcontacts.html</a>)</span></span></blockquote><span itemprop="name">(via <a href="http://lists.hum.ku.dk/pipermail/papy/2015-July/001903.html">http://lists.hum.ku.dk/pipermail/papy/2015-July/001903.html</a> )</span> ]]></content>
