      width="154" /></a>This monograph offers a large number of unpublished text fragments
      in photo and transliteration and gives succinct philological notes to these fragments. The
      fragments are part of a large collection that had been found during the early German campaigns
      at the Hittite capital Hattusa before the Second World War. The fragments were taken to the
      Staatliche Museen in Berlin (which fell to Eastern Germany after the war) and were finally
      returned by the German Democratic Republic to Turkey (the Museum of Ancient Anatolian
      Civilizations, Ankara) in the year 1987. They were then divided among a team of eminent Turkish
      Hittitologists under the supervision of Sedat Alp, but most of the pieces remained unpublished.
      Following a decision of the Turkish Ministry of Culture in 2010, a new team was formed, partly
      consisting of members of the former team, but also supplemented by several Turkish
      Hittitologists of the younger generation. The author of the present monograph is one of these
      new team members.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">Oğuz Soysal
      is an experienced Hittitologist and the author of a number of important publications, which
      have received much attention in the field. In more than one case he has already dealt with
      unpublished fragments, and on these occasions he has shown himself to be a skilled editor of
      new texts. As a collaborator of the Hittite Dictionary of the University of Chicago, Soysal was
      able to draw upon the rich lexical files of this project in order to assign fragments to a text
      or even join them together with other fragments.</span><br /> <span
      style="font-size: x-small;">Soysal provides photographs and transliterations of each piece.
      Photos offer the users of his book all the information needed on the sign forms of the
      fragments, and the transliterations show how Soysal has interpreted those signs. Wherever
      necessary, Soysal gives philological notes to explain certain forms or to present relevant text
      variants. Each fragment, if possible, is accompanied by information on its assignment to a
      Hittite text or text genre, the date of the composition, the fragmentʼs measurements, and
      previous bibliography. After the presentation of the fragments highly useful indexes on
      onomastics and lexicographical matters close the book.</span><br />
