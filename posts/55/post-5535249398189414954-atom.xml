   <title type="text">POINIKASTAS:  EPIGRAPHIC SOURCES FOR EARLY GREEK WRITING</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span class="page-title"><a href="http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/introduction.shtml" target="_parent">POINIKASTAS: &nbsp;EPIGRAPHIC SOURCES FOR EARLY GREEK WRITING</a></span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="page-title"><img alt="http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/img/GlyphsFaint.jpg" height="141" src="https://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/img/GlyphsFaint.jpg" width="200" /> </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Anne Jeffery Archive is a collection of papers and photographs assembled by <a href="http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/memoire/LHJ-introduction.html"><u>L.H. Jeffery</u></a> (known as "Anne Jeffery") throughout her working life. It was  bequeathed to the Faculty of Literae Humaniores at Oxford University on  her death in 1986 and comprises one hundred foolscap folders, two  "scribbling diaries" and one large tin of photographic negatives.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The section of the archive relating directly to the production of <i>The Local Scripts of Archaic Greece</i> ("<i>LSAG</i>")  has been catalogued and digitised, as part of a programme of work  (Script, Image and the Culture of Writing in the Ancient World) funded  by the <a href="htttp://www.mellon.org" target="_parent">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>.  This portion of the archive amounts to about five thousand pages of  notes filed in seventy-seven of the folders. The notes themselves are  typically written in pencil and include observations, bibliography,  transliterations and drawings of epigraphic documents. The drawings, of  which there are roughly four thousand in this section of the archive,  are of particular interest. Many are originals and in numerous cases the  images sketched by Jeffery give a clear impression of the  three-dimensional context of a given piece of ancient writing. This is  all the more true when the drawings are combined with photographs from  the archive, about six hundred of which concern texts catalogued in <i>LSAG</i>.  The photographs are mostly black and white negatives taken by Jeffery  herself using a medium format (6cm x 6cm) Rolleiflex camera, the few  exceptions being the occasional print obtained for the purposes of  research or sent by others with a request for expert advice.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Anne Jeffery did not originally intend her papers to become an  archive and so was frugal and imaginative in her choice of stationery.  Some notes were made on clean sheets of paper of a fairly standard size  but others were made on whatever scraps came to hand, whether the backs  of draft publications, administrative circulars or odd envelopes. Many  of these materials do not age well and the result is that the archive is  deteriorating. This factor has added urgency to the digitisation  project.</span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The papers and photographs in the Anne Jeffery Archive complement and enrich <i>LSAG</i>.  They add substantially to the brief entries on individual inscriptions  in the book. The aim of this project is to make the archive available in  electronic form as a new and extensible resource for studying the  development of the Greek alphabet. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/introduction.shtml"><u>introduction</u></a> | <a href="http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/search-browse.shtml"><u>search &amp; browse inscriptions</u></a> | <a href="http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/mapGallery/overview.shtml"><u>map gallery</u></a> | <a href="http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/memoire/LHJ-introduction.html"><u>about Anne Jeffery</u></a> | <a href="http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/about.shtml"><u>about this site</u></a></span> </blockquote>]]></content>
