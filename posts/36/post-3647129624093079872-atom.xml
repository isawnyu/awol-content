      style="font-size: x-small;">The Hellenistic period begins formally with Alexanderâ€™s arrival
      in the Near East in 334 B.C.E. However, this date should not be seen as the beginning of
      Hellenistic influence in this region. The Near East as a whole and the Land of Israel and its
      Jewish residents more particularly were subject to increasing Aegean influence beginning
      already in the fourteenth century B.C.E. Due to increased trade connections, this influence
      became much more extensive during the Persian period when Greek coinage became the standard in
      the Land of Israel. The cultural phenomenon we call Hellenism was a power which would have a
      lasting impact on Judaism and the Jewish people.</span><br /><span

      style="font-size: x-small;">The years of Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine rule in Judea and
      of Sassanian rule in Babylonia were years of great challenge to the ongoing continuity of
      Judaism, and, at the same time, years of great accomplishment which resulted in the successful
      meeting of these challenges. By the time the period of Late Antiquity drew to a close, Judaism
      had survived the challenges of Hellenization, sectarianism, violent revolution, and even
      anti-Semitism. In addition, the development of Israelite religion into the rabbinic tradition
      took place in these very same years. The many transitions that took place in this period are
      what effectively made possible the long-term continuity of Judaism as an exilic religion, able
      to enter the medieval period with a new consensus on how to face the future and explain the
      past.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span
