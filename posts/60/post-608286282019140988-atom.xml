She was the first female   graduate of New Zealand’s Laidlaw College to be awarded a Doctorate in   Theology. It was awarded by&nbsp;the Australian College of Theology, again   the first awarded to a woman by thesis (others had been <em>honoris causa</em>)<em>.</em> Her thesis was published in 2005 by Eisenbrauns entitled <em>The Reconstructed Chronology of the Divided Kingdom</em>.   She completed this present work two weeks before her death. Her   husband, Rev. Barry Tetley (M.Div. Hons.) has been in Christian ministry   for 45 years, including 12 years as a lecturer at NZ's Laidlaw  College.  He was responsible for the final editing of the text. <br /><br />  The  central chronological thesis of this presentation is established  by the  concordance of inscriptional and astronomical evidence available  to Dr  Tetley at the time of compilation. It radically differs from  most  chronological estimates in current Egyptological publications. <br /><br />It    establishes the early use of a civil Calendar in Upper Egypt with Wep    Renpet as the first month, with a changing four-year link to the    annual heliacal rising of Sothis, referred to in inscriptions. A great    number of events reported in historical materials link to new or full    moon events, that are pin-pointed by secure astronomical evidence. This    evidence establishes the date of Neferefre's reign as the earliest    secure date in Egyptian history. From this date, together with analysis    of the Turin Canon, the reconstructed Royal Annals, and other ancient    king-lists, Dr Tetley establishes new dates for the first five    dynasties. Later dynastic records contain numerous sothic or lunar    references, which enable the reconstruction of a chronology that    conforms to astronomical evidence. Such evidence is not susceptible to    the vagaries of guess-work and estimation from a flawed starting date,    as is currently relied upon in much of the present information  available   to the public. <br /><br />Dr Tetley's methodology must be  examined on its  merits. The study of Ancient Egypt is ongoing, and Dr  Tetley hoped that  her contribution to its chronology would provide  answers with a  confidence that has so far eluded the Egyptology  community. <br /><br />   New information can fill “knowledge gaps” and  further refine her  endeavour. The editor invites readers who recognize  such gaps, or errors  in the compiled material, to communicate directly  with him. Any  material of chronological significance that could improve  and refine <em>The  Reconstructed Chronology of the Egyptian Kings</em> would be exactly within  the intentions of Dr Tetley, and would be  considered for inclusion and  recognition within the existing narrative.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></blockquote>]]></content>
