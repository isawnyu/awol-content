      Standards</a><br /><br />CDLN 2011:006 <br />Robert K. Englund: <a

      />The CDLN has recently changed its publication practices. New submissions will appear in
      preprint status four times a year (January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1; notices of new
      submissions will be made to this list). During the preprint period, authors will be able to
      make small, non-substantive changes (e.g. typographical errors) to their submissions. After two
      weeks, these submissions are then archived. <br /><br />The <a
      href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlninfo.html">CDLN</a>, together with its sister
      publications <a href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlb.html">Cuneiform DigitalLibrary
      Bulletin (CDLB)</a> and <a href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlj.html">Cuneiform
      Digital Library Journal (CDLJ)</a>, are peer-reviewed publications that offer a
      persistent web presence under the auspices of the University of California system. As
      e-journals, the delay between submission and publication is well below that of academic print
      journals, while the interaction with cuneiform artifacts documented in the CDLI database offers
      obvious strengths for an interactive and discourse. Authors should expect a two to four month
      interval between submission of a draft text with illustrations and its publication for
      substantive contributions to the CDLJ, at most two months for those made to the Bulletin, and
      approximately two weeks for the Notes that are conceived as an online venue for NABU-style
      communications that can include short philological or lexicographical contributions as well as
      regular updates of a more substantial nature describing the background or progress of, in
      particular, web-based research efforts. <br /><br />Scholars are encouraged to send
      contributions to the CDLN at allred at ucla dot edu.</span></blockquote>]]></content>
