   <title type="text">From Stone to Screen: Putting the Squeeze on Digitization</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://fromstonetoscreen.com/" rel="home" title="From Stone to Screen">From Stone to Screen: Putting the Squeeze on Digitization</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">There are over 1,000 artifacts and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asia.si.edu/research/squeezeproject/sq_making.asp" target="_blank">squeezes</a>&nbsp;  of inscriptions in the collection of the &nbsp;Department of Classical, Near  Eastern, and Religious Studies of The University of British  Columbia.&nbsp;Until now, the collection was only available on site in  Vancouver. We are excited to announce the beginning of our effort to  make these objects available for study to scholars and students around  the world.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The majority of our squeeze collection is of inscriptions found in  the Athenian Agora and include the Athenian Tribute Lists from the 5th  century BCE. The squeeze collection was primarily the work of Malcolm  McGregor, head of the UBC Classics Department from 1954 to his  retirement in 1975.&nbsp;The artifacts were donated to the department by  George Fuller and are currently awaiting in-depth study. The collection  consists of a number of&nbsp;lamps, glazed ceramics and amulets from North  Africa, Palestine and Egypt.</span><br /><br /> <div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Graduate students from the CNERS Department at UBC have  begun a collaborative project to create a digital database of the  department’s archaeological teaching collections&nbsp;for the benefit of  students and faculty alike. There is a significant collection of  archaeological material in the possession of the department that is, at  present, inaccessible and unavailable to students. Through the creation  of a digital database we aim to fulfil the following objectives:</span></div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: x-small;">1) to create a useful and meaningful online resource that can be modified and augmented in future years; </span></div><div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: x-small;">2) to bolster the department’s online presence; and</span></div><div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: x-small;">3) to establish a collaborative project for the graduate  students to contribute to and work on together with the hopes of gaining  experience in the Digital Humanities and creating a legacy for future  students.</span></div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">The fundamental project would consist of the database  itself. We envision a multi-lingual, navigable resource which allows  students to examine the objects for purpose of individual study or as a  pedagogical tool. The first category of objects to be studied will be  the epigraphic squeezes currently stored in the slide room. These are an  obvious first choice, as their utility as a resource for countless  members of the department is undeniable. By making these available,  students and faculty will have the opportunity to study epigraphic  records which are valuable for scholars of literature, history, and  archaeology alike. Ideally, the squeezes would be studied individually,  catalogued, photographed (and possibly scanned), and then entered into a  digital database.</span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><nav id="access" role="navigation">				<div class="skip-link screen-reader-text"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://fromstonetoscreen.com/#content" title="Skip to content">Skip to content</a></span></div><div class="menu"><ul class="menu" id="prime_nav"><li class="menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-541" id="menu-item-541"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://fromstonetoscreen.com/?page_id=433"><span>Profiles</span></a></span></li><li class="menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-has-children menu-item-531" id="menu-item-531"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://fromstonetoscreen.com/?page_id=428"><span>About the Project</span></a></span> </li><li class="menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-534" id="menu-item-534"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://fromstonetoscreen.com/?page_id=490"><span>References and Links</span></a></span></li><li class="menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-540" id="menu-item-540"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://fromstonetoscreen.com/?page_id=538"><span>Blog</span></a></span></li></ul></div></nav></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">And see also AWOL's entry on the <a href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2014/10/mcgregor-squeeze-collection-digitization.html">McGregor Squeeze Collection Digitization</a></div>]]></content>
