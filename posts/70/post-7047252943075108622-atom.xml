The back office has  a very rich and powerful interface for complex queries. Don't hesitate  to write to us if you wish to join the project or if you would like to  suggest new features or corrections.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">We are currently working on a tool that will automatically convert  versifications of one Bible to another (i.e. Peshitta to LXX).</span><br /><br /> </div></div></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">In Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, few people knew how to read or  write. The common person usually became familiar with texts by hearing  them recited or by seeing them represented artistically in liturgical,  theatrical and ritual performances. <strong>Lectionaries </strong>– broadly understood as texts of different genres which inform the liturgical performance of one or more biblical passages –<strong> are the key link between the Bible and people, between intellectuals  and the uneducated, between theory and praxis and, therefore, between  the fields of literary and ritual studies</strong>. As such,  lectionaries are important not only for scholars of Eastern and Western  liturgies, but also for exegetes of the Old and New Testaments as well  as for historians researching Jewish – Christian relations. In short,  they are essential for any scholar attempting to understand Christianity  and Judaism as living religions both in the past and present. This  database is a deliberate attempt to bring to the fore the dimensions of  liturgical performance and ritual in the study of early Christianity and  Judaism, where texts continue to be perceived as falling primarily  under the elitist domains of philology, dogma and literature.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Scholarly Aims</strong></span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">Our aim is to assemble the vast data contained in all ancient  lectionaries, both Jewish and Christian, and make them easily accessible  for and conveniently searchable by scholars interested in liturgy, the <em>Wirkungsgeschichte</em> of biblical texts, as well as by historians. We truly believe that  publishing materials on the web is the most convenient way to provide  free and immediate access to those important texts which form the basis  for much of human culture. Publicizing these materials electronically  allows anyone with internet access to utilize these texts and enables  these materials to reach a broader audience.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Why Is This Database Important and to Whom?</strong></span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">This database will enable <strong>biblical scholars</strong> to quickly research the ritual <em>Sitz</em><em> im Leben</em> of scriptural chapters or verses, which is critical for studying the impact of the Bible (the <em>Wirkungsgeschichte</em>). In addition, <strong>liturgical experts</strong> will be able to compare different reading traditions more easily and comprehensively. <strong>Historians as well as </strong><strong>patristic</strong><strong> and rabbinic scholars</strong> can utilize the database for a variety of purposes, such as finding the  chronological and liturgical context of a homily or evaluating whether a  biblical pericope might have an impact during a particular season of  the year. With the help of the database, scholars will also be able to  compare the prevalence of a text within the database to the number of  extant exegetical treatises, along with carrying out many other  statistical queries.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">                         <br /><div class="block block-superfish first last odd" id="block-superfish-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;">          </span><div class="content"><span style="font-size: x-small;">    </span><ul class="menu sf-menu sf-main-menu sf-horizontal sf-style-default sf-total-items-7 sf-parent-items-2 sf-single-items-5 superfish-processed sf-js-enabled sf-shadow" id="superfish-1"><li class="active-trail first odd sf-item-1 sf-depth-1 sf-no-children" id="menu-227-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="sf-depth-1 active" href="http://www.lectionary.eu/">Home</a></span></li><li class="middle even sf-item-2 sf-depth-1 sf-total-children-4 sf-parent-children-0 sf-single-children-4 menuparent" id="menu-364-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="sf-depth-1 menuparent sf-with-ul" href="http://www.lectionary.eu/node/1" title="Informations about the project ThALES">About the project<span class="sf-sub-indicator"> »</span></a></span></li><li class="middle odd sf-item-3 sf-depth-1 sf-no-children" id="menu-365-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="sf-depth-1" href="http://www.lectionary.eu/thales-database/?lg=EN&amp;u=sign-in" title="Access to the ThALES Database">The ThALES Database</a></span></li><li class="middle even sf-item-4 sf-depth-1 sf-no-children" id="menu-653-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="sf-depth-1" href="http://www.lectionary.eu/content/acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</a></span></li><li class="middle odd sf-item-5 sf-depth-1 sf-total-children-5 sf-parent-children-0 sf-single-children-5 menuparent" id="menu-437-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="sf-depth-1 menuparent sf-with-ul" href="http://www.lectionary.eu/content/resources" title="A bibliography and links to other websites, projects, electronic tools">Resources<span class="sf-sub-indicator"> »</span></a></span></li><li class="middle even sf-item-6 sf-depth-1 sf-no-children" id="menu-897-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="sf-depth-1" href="http://www.lectionary.eu/content/tutorials">Tutorials</a></span></li><li class="last odd sf-item-7 sf-depth-1 sf-no-children" id="menu-447-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="sf-depth-1" href="http://www.lectionary.eu/content/contact">Contact</a></span></li></ul></div></div></blockquote><strong></strong>]]></content>
