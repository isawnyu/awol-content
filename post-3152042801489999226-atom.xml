These geographic theories were further  developed during the Hellenistic period and were later adopted and  implemented by Roman geographers.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">                    </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">                        In studying the shape and size of the Earth,  ancient geographers developed the fundamentals of topography and  cartography, the sciences of recording the surface of the terrain  through drawings, as we still know them today. In particular, Roman  surveyors introduced the concepts of measurable and measured space, and  the visualization of the terrain through lines of demarcation. Their  work became instrumental for administrators and generals whose main goal  was to control and exploit the expanse of lands.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">                    </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">                        Our modern knowledge of ancient cartography  relies almost exclusively on written sources. Despite this paucity of  ancient artifacts, it is clear that Greeks and Romans applied  topographical studies to the mapping of land and sea routes, to the  implementation of an accurate system of recording public and private  lands, and to promote specific political agendas. In all these  instances, the resulting representations of places presented the viewer  with a distorted and schematized version of geographic and topographic  elements, transforming those regions both on a conceptual and on a  physical level.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">                    </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">                        In the exhibition, several artifacts and  manuscripts illustrate the ways in which space was conceptualized not  only through topography and cartography, but also according to  non-geographical elements such as strategy and tactics. Indeed, official  propaganda during the Roman imperial period consistently boosted the  emperors’ agendas by performing acts of ‘imaginative geography’,  out-and-out manipulations of known geographic facts that contributed to  the creation of ever shifting social, ethnic, political, and cultural  boundaries.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">                    </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">                        In addition to measuring, drawing and  manipulating their known world, Greeks and Romans developed a  flourishing literature of geographic <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/space/glossary.html#mirabilia" lang="lat">mirabilia</a>, in part inspired by the perceived secluded nature of their <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/space/glossary.html#oikoumene" lang="grc-Latn">oikoumene</a>.  These texts, which had a wide impact on the shared geographic knowledge  of individuals of all social categories, paired the knowledge of actual  territories with hypothetical constructions of what existed beyond  ancient ken, drawing both on actual facts from exploration and trade as  well as pure fabrication. The objects on display show how geographical  remoteness translated into projections of mythical and semi-mythical  societies outside their controllable universe, ranging from the bizarre  to the utopian.                     </span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">                </span></blockquote></div><blockquote></blockquote></div><blockquote><div class="navbar navbar-fixed-top"><div class="navbar-inner"><div class="container-fluid"><ul class="nav"><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/space/index.html">Home</a></span></li><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/space/visit.html">Visit</a></span></li><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><li class="active"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/space/intro.html">Introduction</a></span></li><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/space/checklist.html">On Display</a></span></li><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/space/online.html">Online</a></span></li><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/space/events.html">Public Events</a></span></li><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/space/curators.html">Curators</a></span></li><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/space/bibliography.html">Bibliography</a></span></li><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/space/press.html">Press</a></span></li></ul></div></div></div></blockquote>]]></content>
