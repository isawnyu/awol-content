   <title type="text">The Friedberg Genizah Project (FGP) Version 10</title>
   <content type="html">&lt;a href="http://www.genizah.org/"&gt;The Friedberg Genizah  Project (FGP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email update: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;The Friedberg Genizah Project&lt;br /&gt;November 12, 2012&lt;br /&gt;Announcement No. 12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear User,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Genazim" is pleased to announce the launching of Version 10 of the&lt;br /&gt;Genizah website.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following is an overview of the improvements in this version.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. Images&lt;br /&gt;1. Cambridge&lt;br /&gt;With great satisfaction we announce the recent successful completion (on&lt;br /&gt;time!) of the complex project of digitizing the entire Genizah collection&lt;br /&gt;of the Cambridge University Library, a project designed and planned in&lt;br /&gt;cooperation with the Genizah Research Unit of CUL, and implemented&lt;br /&gt;by CUL Each fragment of the CUL Genizah was digitized and is&lt;br /&gt;currently displayed on the website. We are now in the process of applying&lt;br /&gt;a final comprehensive check to verify that indeed all of the Genizah&lt;br /&gt;fragments have been digitized, and that no image is missing from our&lt;br /&gt;website.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Birmingham&lt;br /&gt;The Genizah collection in the Birmingham Library – including its two&lt;br /&gt;sub-collections Mingana and Mittwoch – has been digitized in its entirety&lt;br /&gt;and is now displayed on the website. Our sincere thanks to the Library&lt;br /&gt;staff for their generous cooperation in this task.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Manchester&lt;br /&gt;Genazim is glad to report that an agreement has been reached with the&lt;br /&gt;Manchester University Library, according to which FGP will receive a&lt;br /&gt;copy of the high-quality images of its entire Genizah collection, together&lt;br /&gt;with a copy of all the appropriate metadata and cataloging details&lt;br /&gt;available there. The metadata were already received and are now being&lt;br /&gt;processed for integration in the website; the images are expected to be&lt;br /&gt;received here very soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We wish to thank the Library and all the Officers and the technical&lt;br /&gt;support persons in charge for their cooperation spirit, their support and&lt;br /&gt;their good will in bringing this important initiative to its happy end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B. "Ginzei Kedem"&lt;br /&gt;All the 8 volumes of "Ginzei Kedem" – a Journal devoted to Genizah&lt;br /&gt;research and published by the Ben-Zvi Institute - can now be viewed as&lt;br /&gt;PDF files in the website, and can be searched (in a specific volume or in&lt;br /&gt;all volumes together) for a word, and the appropriate results will be&lt;br /&gt;displayed. These functions may be operated by clicking on "Ginzei&lt;br /&gt;Kedem" on the bottom part of the website Homepage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C. Software&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Physical attributes of a Fragment&lt;br /&gt;With the display of an image, it is possible now to see important data on&lt;br /&gt;the physical attributes of that fragment, such as external and internal&lt;br /&gt;dimensions, number of lines, margin width, average height of a line,&lt;br /&gt;density of the text and more, as recently computed automatically by&lt;br /&gt;Genazim software for almost all Genizah images , by clicking on the icon&lt;br /&gt;that is found in the list of icons above the image.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This function is presently operational for shelfmarks that contain only a&lt;br /&gt;single folio fragment, and it will be extended to all images in the near&lt;br /&gt;future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Search on Computerized Data of a fragment's physical attributes&lt;br /&gt;Until now it was possible to combine in the advanced search the physical&lt;br /&gt;attributes of a fragment, such as dimensions, number of lines, and more,&lt;br /&gt;as long as they existed in the catalog record of the corresponding&lt;br /&gt;shelfmark. With the new version, the user can extend the search to take&lt;br /&gt;into account also these attributes when they were automatically computed&lt;br /&gt;by the system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Filter Mechanism&lt;br /&gt;For efficiency and simplicity reasons, the default in the filter mechanism&lt;br /&gt;is now "No Filter", as opposed to the status that existed till now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Various Fixes and Enhancements&lt;br /&gt;A number of software bugs that appeared very rarely were fixed, and a&lt;br /&gt;number of small enhancements were introduced that will not be detailed&lt;br /&gt;here but which the user will notice during his work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, remarks and suggestions would be most welcome.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genazim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>
