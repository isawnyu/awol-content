However, in the case of the ancient languages, this  value is not always easy to reconstruct. After the most recent studies  on this topic, the publication in the last ten years of the first two  volumes of Chancery Texts from the Ebla Archives has provided an  important corpus to better investigate the use of prepositions in the  Ebla language. More than the previously studied Lexical and  Administrative Texts, similar to and more appropriately than the Ritual  ones, the Chancery Texts (besides letters, several treaties, accounts,  legal texts, etc.) do reflect the language used, even if in different  registers, and in some cases in diachronic and diatopic variations. The  present study concentrates both on the Chancery and the Ritual Texts,  treating them separately. The numerous occurrences of each preposition  of the new corpus have been carefully analyzed, in order to better  understand their «basic value» and verify all of their previously  suggested derived meanings, ambiguity or «interchangeability», always  considering, among the other things, the possibility of a different  «perspective» between the translator’s and the translated languages, and  of idiomatic verb/preposition usages. A similar analysis has been  undertaken for the Ritual Texts, but more focused on the diachronic  aspects: the presence in the new corpus of some texts belonging to the  older phase of the Archives (the reign of Yirkab-Damu) allows in fact  for a fruitful comparison with the more ancient version of the Ritual  for the Royal Wedding. Some relevant data for the diachronic analysis  can also be derived from the recently published Administrative Texts of  the same ancient period. The synchronic and diachronic analysis of all  the prepositions led eventually, on the one hand, to the definition of a  much clearer and more coherent picture of their usage and value, and on  the other hand to detect some important changes the system went through  during the forty years of the Archives. The most relevant case is that  of ašta, ašti, aštu, which, contrary to their generally assumed  interchangeability, revealed clear distinctions in their usage. A  tentative diachronic explanation of their rare overlaps is also  suggested by the texts. But other interesting data emerge from the  analysis of prepositions: their usage in the Abarsal Treaty, for  instance, points to a different dialect from the one of Ebla, which  seems confirmed by some peculiar linguistic and graphic features of this  same text.</span></div></div></blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">                </span><br /><div id="articleTitle"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://edizionicf.unive.it/index.php/Ant/article/view/449">Microstorie di romanizzazione  Le iscrizioni del sepolcreto rurale di Cerrione</a>&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><br /><div id="authorString"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Giovannella Cresci Marrone, Patrizia Solinas</i></span></div><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><br /><div id="articleAbstract"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div><span style="font-size: x-small;">This volume contains the edition and commentary of sixty funerary  inscriptions found at the archaeological site of Cerrione in the  province of Biella, in north-eastern Piedmont, near the Bessa ancient  gold district, in the territory once belonging to the Roman colony of  Eporedia. Seven inscriptions were written in the so-called Lepontic  alphabet, while fifty-three were written in the Latin alphabet. All  these inscriptions were found in a rural necropolis, which appears to  have been used from the early first century BC to the late fourth  century AD. More than two hundred tombs were brought to light in this  necropolis of which about eighty were marked with stone slabs. The  burials that are identified by inscriptions can be dated through their  archaeological contexts to a period that goes from the early first  century BC to the third century AD.Studying these epigraphic texts with  special attention to onomastics allows the book’s author to investigate  the juridical status, the social ranking, the family networks, and the  ethnic identification of the people who were buried in the tombs.  Furthermore, the analysis of the graphic and linguistic features of  these funerary inscriptions facilitates the understanding of the  characteristics and the peculiarities of the cultural transition that  this area went through when they were written. In fact, not only does  this work offer a socio-cultural investigation of the individuals who  lived in this settlement and made use of its cemetery, but,  reconstructing a number of micro-histories, it also contributes to  understanding the dynamics of the contacts between the indigenous Celtic  element and the exogenous Roman influence. The meeting of these two  different cultural systems gave birth to the phenomena of hybridization  and transition that eventually led to the Romanization of this area.</span></div></blockquote></div><table class="tocArticle" style="width: 100%px;"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td class="tocTitle"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://edizionicf.unive.it/index.php/Ant/issue/view/92">Festòs protopalaziale.

The analytical  study of stratigraphical/contextual data and MM IB-MM IIB ceramics  retrieved from these two structures has been my starting point for  attempting a new definition of the ceramic sequence of Protopalatial  Phaistos, which consists of four ceramic phases (A-B-C-D) corresponding  to Early MM IB, MM IB, MM IIA and MM IIB. The publication of the  architecture and large ceramic assemblages from these two structures  provides an important illustration of the first crucial phases of the  palatial site of Phaistos and contributes to a better understanding of  the history of this important Aegean Bronze Age site.</span> &nbsp;</blockquote></div></blockquote><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;<span class="titol"><span class="text">See the full <a href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2012/07/alphabetical-list-of-open-access.html">List of Open Access Journals in Ancient Studies</a></span></span></span></div>]]></content>
