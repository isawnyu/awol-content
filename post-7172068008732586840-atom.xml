   <title type="text">DAMSEG - Database of Archaeological Material from Swedish Excavations in Greece</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sia.gr/sv/damseg">DAMSEG - Database of Archaeological Material from Swedish Excavations in Greece</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://www.sia.gr/themes/sia/images/bg-header_800.jpg" src="http://www.sia.gr/themes/sia/images/bg-header_800.jpg" /></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The database has been compiled as an inventory of mainly published and           exhibited material from the Swedish excavations in the Argolid.  This          database can, and hopefully will be extended in the future  to encompass          material from all Swedish excavations in Greece.  It will eventually comprise          both human and animal bones and  information on conservation treatment          of ceramics and metals.  We also hope it can be complemented with photographs,          drawings,  diaries etc in the future. <br />As indicated the database is primarily  an inventory, but it can also          be used to assist scholars in the  study of material in the Nauplion Museum          storerooms from the  Swedish excavations in the Argolid. To facilitate          such a study  further, material from the same excavations stored in other         collections and museums has been added...</span><br /><h2> <span style="font-size: x-small;"> What material can presently be found in the database</span></h2><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">All material from the Swedish excavations so far published, is  included            in the database, whether in Nauplion or in the other  stated museums.            This further holds true for all material in  the new exhibitions in            the Nauplion Museum and a small amount  of material, which received            NM inventory numbers a long time  ago. On the other hand, there is still            inventoried material  (which was entered into the Museum inventory ledgers            a long  time ago), which has not yet been included in the database,             as it came to out attention only recently. This is the material which             we had largely thought of as lost during the Second World War,  but            which has, to our great satisfaction, resurfaced in the  basement storerooms        of the Leonardo. </span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><br /><h2> <span style="font-size: x-small;"> How to use the database</span></h2><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">As pointed out above the database is above all an inventory and has  not            been created primarily as a research tool. The reasons  should be obvious.            There was no standardized way of recording  material in the old days            and therefore exact proveniences  are mostly not extant. This is not            to say that the database  cannot be used as a research tool. It records            the material  excavated by Swedish archaeologists and stored in the            said  museums and thus anyone who wishes to study this material can             refer to it, when applying for permits to do so. This is particularly             important for applications, where it is required to list each  individual            object to be studied. The database will further  greatly facilitate            work both for the staff of the Museum at  Nauplion and at the Institute.            Museum inventory numbers have  been included where extant, following            the museum standards of  ascribing numbers to complete or nearly complete        objects and  objects of particular value.</span> </blockquote>Free access after registration<br /><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><b>Search by:</b></span></td>        </tr><tr>          <td colspan="2"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://damseg.sia.gr/db/search_publication.asp">Publication reference</a></span></td>          </tr><tr>          <td colspan="2"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://damseg.sia.gr/db/search_material_site.asp">Site and material</a></span></td>          </tr><tr>          <td colspan="2"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://damseg.sia.gr/db/search_chronology_material.asp">Chronology and               material</a></span></td>          </tr><tr>          <td colspan="2"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://damseg.sia.gr/db/search_museum_location.asp">Museum location</a></span></td>        </tr><tr>          <td colspan="2"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://damseg.sia.gr/db/search_freetext.asp">Freetext</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>]]></content>
