   <title type="text">ΛΟΓΕΙΟΝ Online</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu/">ΛΟΓΕΙΟΝ</a><br />     <br /><ul><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://turgot.ci.uchicago.edu/dvlg_tests/">Logeion</a> (literally, a place for words; in particular, <a href="http://turgot.ci.uchicago.edu/dvlg_tests/index.html#%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%B5%E1%BF%96%CE%BF%CE%BD">a speaker's platform</a>, or an <a href="http://turgot.ci.uchicago.edu/dvlg_tests/index.html#logeum">archive</a>) was developed after the example of <a href="http://dvlf.uchicago.edu/" title="">dvlf.uchicago.edu</a>,  to provide simultaneous lookup of entries in the many reference works  that make up the Perseus Classical collection. To improve the  chronological range for which the dictionaries are useful, we have added  DuCange (see below), and to enhance this site as both a research and a  pedagogical tool, we add information based on corpus data in the right  side bar, as well as references to chapters in standard textbooks. More  such 'widgets' will be added over time, along with, we hope, still more  dictionaries.<br /></span> </li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Logeion interface only allows for consulting dictionaries the  way dictionaries were originally conceived: Type in the headword (or  lemma) for the entry (transliterated Greek is an option) and the word  wheel will spin to what we hope will be the right destination. Enter a  minimum of three characters, and the system will attempt to suggest  entries in the neighborhood.  <br /></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">For full-text searches (where in LSJ do we find reference to  Xenophon's Anabasis, where is λόγος used in any entry, not just in the  entry for λόγος), use the links in the list of sources below. Full-text  search is only possible for the reference works that are fully in the  public domain. Below, the home page will be specified for projects that  have a presence online, which may include many further options for  searching.<br /></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">This site has been developed by Josh Goldenberg and Matt Shanahan in  the summer of 2011. In addition, many thanks to ARTFL, as always, and  in particular to Richard Whaling and to the DVLF crew for initial  consultation. We hope you will find Logeion useful! Comments and  suggestions: please email Helma Dik; or use the link above to Report a  Problem. <br /></span> </li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Update January 2012:  We have now added a Latin-Dutch dictionary to the collection: The <i>Woordenboek Latijn/Nederlands.</i> One notable feature of this dictionary, for those who do not speak  Dutch, is that a lot of attention has been paid to ensure accuracy of  vowel length for the lexical entries. For further information see below. </span>  </li></ul>]]></content>
