   <title type="text">Survey into the use of large-scale digital collections</title>
   <content type="html">&lt;a href="https://opinio.ucl.ac.uk/s?s=15519"&gt;Survey into the use of large-scale digital collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;This survey is part of a research project being undertaken at the UCL  Centre of Digital Humanities, and aims to learn more about the  experiences of users of large-scale digital collections (LSDIs), and  specifically digitised newspaper collections. LSDIs are large  collections of digitised print and other media that can be viewed using a  computer; the most famous example is Google Book Search, and other  projects include the British Library's digital collections. This project  is looking in particular at the British Library's 19th Century  Newspaper Collection. If you are a user of this resource, then your  opinions will be extremely valuable in helping us to discover how people  are using the British Library's collections of digitised newspapers,  but we are also eager to hear opinions from users of other large-scale  digital collections, whether they contain newspapers or other media. If  you use LSDIs for any purpose, whether work, research or personal  interest, then please fill in the survey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This survey will take  approximately 30 minutes to complete. All responses given will be  anonymous and confidential, and we will not collect identifying  information such as your name or IP address. You may choose not to  participate at any time. If you decide to participate in this research  survey, you may withdraw at any time. If you decide not to participate  in this study or if you withdraw from participating at any time, your  data will not be stored...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>
