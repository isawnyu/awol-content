   <title type="text">Pietro Bracci's 'lost' manuscript</title>
   <content type="html">Newly online at the &lt;a href="http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/"&gt;Griffith Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/bracci-special/"&gt;Pietro Bracci's 'lost' manuscript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Geroglifici ed Obelischi Eggizzi&lt;/i&gt;, 'opera postuma inedita di &lt;a href="permalink:%20http://viaf.org/viaf/5845052"&gt;Pietro Bracci&lt;/a&gt;', 1767&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;           &lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Pietro Bracci (1700-1773) was a leading Roman sculptor of his  time. Among his most important works are the colossal Oceanus (or  Neptune) of the Trevi Fountain and the sculptures for several funerary  monuments in Rome, including the tombs of Pope Benedict XIII in the  Basilica of Santa Maria sopra Minerva and that of Pope Benedict XIV in  the Basilica of Saint Peter. He is also renowned for a group of busts  and a significant number of drawings which are now dispersed among  numerous museums and collections around the world, including the  Canadian Centre for Architecture and the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, both in  Montreal, and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;However, based on historical inventories of Bracci's manuscripts,  most of them now lost, Bracci had many interests, including  architecture, military engineering and sundials, to mention a few. An  unpublished manuscript by Bracci on Egyptian hieroglyphs, probably  started in the 1750s or 1760s but left unfinished, and which was  believed to be lost, was in fact purchased by Sir Alan H. Gardiner, who  later presented it to the former Ashmolean Museum library, and thence  transferred to the Griffith Institute archive. This work, which  constitutes one of the oldest holdings of the archive, is now being  prepared to finally see the light of day for the first time. To  celebrate Bracci's birthday in the month of June - there is some  uncertainty about the exact date (16th or 26th depending on the author),  we present here scans of some individual pages of this unique "jewel", a  new surviving example of a pre-Champollion attempt to read and  understand the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic script, which is strongly  influenced by the work of Athanasius Kircher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img alt="http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/bracci-special/images/lr/Bracci_001r.jpg" class="decoded" height="200" src="http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/bracci-special/images/lr/Bracci_001r.jpg" width="143" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
