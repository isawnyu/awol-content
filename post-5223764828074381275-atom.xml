   <title type="text">Dolgopolsky's Nostratic Dictionary Online (3rd edition)</title>
   <content type="html">&lt;a href="http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/244080"&gt;Nostratic Dictionary - Third Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a class="author" href="http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/browse?type=author&amp;amp;value=Dolgopolsky%2C+Aharon"&gt;Dolgopolsky, Aharon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Aharon Dolgopolsky was the leading authority on the Nostratic  macrofamily. It is with great sadness that we announce that he passed  away on 20 July 2012. His 'Nostratic Dictionary' presented here is, of  course, something very much more than a dictionary. It is the most  thorough and extensive demonstration and documentation so far of what  may be termed the Nostratic hypothesis: that several of the world's  best-known language families are related in their origin, their grammar  and their lexicon, and that they belong together in a larger unit, of  earlier origin, the Nostratic macrofamily. It should at once be noted  that several elements of this enterprise are controversial. For while  the Nostratic hypothesis has many supporters, it has been criticized on  rather fundamental grounds by a number of distinguished linguists. The  matter was reviewed some years ago in a symposium held at the McDonald  Institute, and positions remain very much polarized. It was a result of  that meeting that the decision was taken to invite Aharon Dolgopolsky to  publish his Dictionary - a much more substantial treatise than any work  hitherto undertaken on the subject - at the McDonald Institute. For it  became clear that the diversities of view expressed at that symposium  were not likely to be resolved by further polemical exchanges. Instead, a  substantial body of data was required, whose examination and evaluation  could subsequently lead to more mature judgments. Those data are  presented here, and that more mature evaluation can now proceed. This  edition is Dolgopolskyâ€™s final one as submitted in January 2012. It is  revised and augmented by the author but remains unedited and unproofed  due to his unfortunate death. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>
