   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://amarna.cast.uark.edu/index.html">Amarna Virtual Museum</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://amarna.cast.uark.edu/images/site1.png" src="http://amarna.cast.uark.edu/images/site1.png" /> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">About the 3D Models  The 3D models provided for each artifact are available for download in  three formats: VRML, 3D PDF, and OBJ. The models provided for the OBJ  format are available in original quality or "high resolution" as well as  reduced quality or "low-resolution." The models provided for the VRML  and 3D PDF formats are only available in low-resolution only. The file  size of the high resolution models ranges from 50-100mb and is  determined largely by the artifact size and original scan resolution. It  is not uncommon for some of the larger, more detailed vessels to have  more than 1,000,000 triangles in the original model. The original, high  resolution models are provided to facilitate detailed metric analysis  using one of the free data viewers suggested below.  <br /><br />  The file size for the reduced quality or "low resolution" models ranges  from 2-5mb. Most of the low resolution models have been reduced to  ~25,000 triangles unless the original high resolution model contained  less than 25,000 triangles in which case the low resolution model was  reduced to half the original model size. The low resolution models were  created to facilitate a 'quick view' of each artifact and are provided  for visualization purposes.    <br /><br /><span class="subtitle"> VRML Format and Free VRML Viewers </span></span>  <span style="font-size: x-small;">VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) is a standard format for  representing 3D models. VRML is a text-based format and was designed  largely for the display of 3D graphics on the web. In fact, most VRML  viewers including the ones listed here interface directly with your web  browser (although stand alone applications are available)... </span></blockquote><br /><div style="text-align: center;">See also <a href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2011/10/amarna-roundup.html">Amarna Roundup</a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/149576487">Amarna in Pleiades </a></div>]]></content>
