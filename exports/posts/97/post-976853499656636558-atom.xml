Greek, Latin, and Egyptian astrological sources for the various systems  of Terms and their origin are reviewed, followed by preliminary editions  and translations of the relevant sections of the tablets. The system of  Terms is shown to be so far the most technically complex component of  Greek astrology to originate in Babylonia. Over the course of the  Hellenistic period an Egyptian origin was ascribed to the systems of  Terms as it was combined with components of Greek horoscopic astrology.  By Ptolemy's day, this spurious history had largely displaced the true.</span></div><div style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Links: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/768969647">worldcat</a>,&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/isaw_papers/items/itemKey/INRT7FVK">zotero</a></span></div><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Catharine Lorber and Andrew Meadows</strong>.

This paper gathers  additional data and applies further methods of modern economic analysis  to reach a different conclusion. It shows that the overall Roman economy  was not fully integrated, although the Mediterranean Sea did create  some meaningful integration along a few privileged trade routes. Still,  it is not possible to identify pure market forces that existed in  isolation, since the political structures that maintained the Empire  strongly influenced the movement of money and trade goods.</span></div><div style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Links:&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/817965432">worldcat</a>,&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/isaw_papers/items/itemKey/VTNEJVFG">zotero</a></span></div><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones</strong>.

In 2005, new data were gathered leading to considerably  enhanced knowledge of its functions and the inscriptions on its  exterior. However, much of the front of the instrument has remained  uncertain due to loss of evidence. We report progress in reading a  passage of one inscription that appears to describe the front of the  Mechanism as a representation of a Greek geocentric cosmology,  portraying the stars, Sun, Moon, and all five planets known in  antiquity. Complementing this, we propose a new mechanical  reconstruction of planetary gearwork in the Mechanism, incorporating an  economical design closely analogous to the previously identified lunar  anomaly mechanism, and accounting for much unresolved physical evidence.</span></span></div><div style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Links:&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828186961">worldcat</a>,&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/isaw_papers/items/itemKey/VQDAMNGH">zotero</a></span></span></div><div id="isaw-papers-5" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Adam C.

The Syriac text in question has been well-known since it was  published in 1889. This particular passage is studied and commented on  here especially as it appears in a recently cataloged manuscript from  Dayr Al-Za‘farān, in which the passage is completely divorced from its  context in the Cause of All Causes.</span></div><div style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Links:&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828186962">worldcat</a>,&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/isaw_papers/items/itemKey/8JUQ7X6F">zotero</a></span></div><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Mantha Zarmakoupi</strong>.

As a term, LOD encompasses approaches to the publication  of digital resources that emphasize stability, relatively fine-grained  access to intellectual content via public URIs, and re-usability as  defined both by publication of machine reabable data and by publication  under licenses that permit further copying of available materials. This  article presents a series of reports from participants in 2012 and 2013  sessions of the NEH-funded Linked Ancient World Data Institute. The  contributors come from a wide range of academic disciplines and  professional backgrounds. The projects they represent reflect this range  and also illustrate many stages of the process of moving from concept  to implementation.</span></div><div style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Links: <a class="external-link" href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/isaw_papers/items/itemKey/HMZ4FRKN">zotero</a></span></div><div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Federico De Romanis. </strong>(2014).
