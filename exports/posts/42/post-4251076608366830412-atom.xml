The new version of <a href="http://numismatics.org/search/">Mantis</a> was <a href="http://numishare.blogspot.com/2014/11/new-version-of-mantis-released.html">launched</a> a few months ago, immediately following the release of a new project, <a href="http://numishare.blogspot.com/2014/08/art-of-devastation-web-based-catalogue.html">The Art of Devastation</a>, which is a type corpus of World War I medals. The first of the Edward T. Newell Greek numismatic research notebooks <a href="http://eaditor.blogspot.com/2014/06/first-newell-notebook-published-in.html">have gone online</a>,  annotated to link to other resources (monographs, coins in the ANS  collection, and other researchers) by means of LOD technologies. The new  version of the ANS archives, <a href="http://numismatics.org/archives/">Archer</a>, has gone online, employing SPARQL to link to another new project, the <a href="http://numismatics.org/authorities/">ANS Biographies</a> (a production installation of EAC-CPF software, <a href="https://github.com/ewg118/xeac">xEAC</a>). In <a href="http://numismatics.org/ocre/">OCRE</a>,  we have completed volume IV of RIC, from Septimius Severus to Uranius  Antoninus. More than 12,000 coins from the British Museum have been <a href="http://numishare.blogspot.com/2014/04/british-museum-coins-in-ocre.html">ingested into the Nomisma triplestore </a>to  be made available in OCRE (with many thanks to Eleanor Ghey from the BM  for providing data dumps in spreadsheets that have allowed me to create  a concordance between their coins in OCRE URIs). The new Bootstrap 3  version of OCRE launched into production last February, the first of the  Numishare projects migrated into that stylistic framework (therefore,  enabling out-of-the-box scaling for mobile devices), and in late March  of 2014, <a href="http://numishare.blogspot.com/2014/04/ans-and-isaw-receive-major-neh-grant-to.html">we received $300,000</a> from the National Endowment for the Humanities to complete the project  over the next three years. Finally, much progress has been made in the  development of a formal RDF ontology for numismatics, in conjunction  with an architectural re-write of Nomisma.org, which has been in  development for much of the year.<br /><br /></span><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Looking Forward</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">We are going to be making at least as much progress in 2015 as 2014,  especially in the first few months of the year. The new Nomisma.org  framework will be released by the end of January. It will be fully  compliant to the latest standards and protocols for a linked data  publication framework. The data model for IDs will be revised  significantly. SKOS will play a much larger role in linking instances  together (via skos:broader), and the instances will conform to formal  classes from the Nomisma ontology. The editing interface for concepts  will be opened up to a wider editing team, and I foresee many more URIs  minted this year, especially outside the realm of ancient numismatics.  There is a large demand for greater representation of Medieval and  Islamic URIs. The editing interface includes improved lookup mechanisms  for linking Nomisma concepts to matching terms in other vocabulary  systems, like <a href="http://viaf.org/">VIAF</a> and the <a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/">Getty thesauri</a>.<br /><br />The main bottleneck for the release of the new version of Nomisma lies in the creation of URIs for Roman Republican moneyers. <a href="http://nomisma.org/rrc">RRC</a> and <a href="http://nomisma.org/id/igch">IGCH</a> URIs are going to be spun off into separate projects, maintained by  specialists are are focused on the curation of those datasets. As a  result, the existing RRC URIs in Nomisma must redirect to URIs in a new  domain name. Additionally, RRC URIs are used in production in several  different projects, so those projects must transition to the new RRC  Online URIs before the URIs are deprecated in the <a href="http://nomisma.org/id/">http://nomisma.org/id/</a> namespace. Before RRC Online can launch, the Republican moneyers must  have URIs in Nomisma. I expect to have the list verified by the end of  the week so that we can move forward with publishing the moneyers in  Nomisma either by this Friday or the first week of January. RRC Online  (which will function exactly like OCRE, but focused on Roman Republican  coinage) will launch soon after. We already have more than 10,000 coins  from&nbsp; the ANS and British Museum ready to be linked into RRC Online, in  addition to several hundred coins from <a href="http://coins.lib.virginia.edu/">The University of Virginia Art Museum</a>, <a href="http://vmfa.museum/">Virginia Museum of Fine Arts</a>, and <a href="http://data.ucd.ie/view/ucdclm:10">University College Dublin</a>.  After the launch of RRC Online, we will move the new version of Nomisma  into production by the end of January. By the time we meet in April in  Berlin to discuss the Online Greek Corpus and Poland to discuss the <a href="http://www.ecfn.fundmuenzen.eu/">European Coin Find Network</a>,  we should have transitioned all projects to use the new Nomisma  ontology, which Karsten Tolle has been working on over the last one to  two years. A draft of the Nomisma documentation should be available in  time for these meetings.<br /><br />We have a number of longer term Greek numismatic projects coming down  the pike. As part of the Online Greek Corpus, we are going to work on  standardizing Seleucid and Alexandrian types within the ANS database, as  well as work on improving IGCH, which will function as a standalone  Greek coin hoard research tool, much like <a href="http://numismatics.org/chrr/">Coin Hoards of the Roman Republic</a>.  The digital IGCH will serve as an important bridge between Greek coins  in the ANS collection and associated bibliographic references. We hope  to show serious progress with respect to Greek projects in time for the <a href="http://www.xvcin.unime.it/">INC</a> meeting in Taormina in late September.<br /><br />Finally, over the course of 2015 and extending a few years into the  future, we are going to work on systematically cleaning up the ANS  collection database, linking denominations, materials, people, etc. to  URIs in Nomisma, the Getty thesauri, VIAF, etc. whenever applicable.  This will dramatically improve the usefulness of Mantis, which is often  limited due to inconsistency in data entry and utter lack of controlled  vocabulary. Furthermore, we are going to work on improving the  bibliographic references, making it easier to traverse from Mantis to <a href="http://donum.numismatics.org/">Donum</a> (the ANS library catalog), <a href="http://worldcat.org/">Worldcat</a>, <a href="http://jstor.org/">JSTOR</a>, etc. to access further information. Mantis will grow into a more useful numismatic research portal over time.</span></blockquote></div><blockquote> </blockquote></div><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <span class="post-author vcard">Posted by <span class="fn">Ethan Gruber</span></span></span><span class="post-timestamp"><span style="font-size: x-small;">at <a class="timestamp-link" href="http://numishare.blogspot.com/2014/12/near-term-progress-in-digital.html" rel="bookmark" title="permanent link"><abbr class="published" title="2014-12-17T07:55:00-08:00">7:55 AM</abbr></a></span></span></blockquote>]]></content>
