   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://digitalcollections.library.ubc.ca/cdm/landingpage/collection/squeezes">McGregor Squeeze Collection Digitization</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The McGregor Squeeze Collection consists of over 1000 epigraphic  squeezes of Greek inscriptions currently held by the Department of  Classical, Near Eastern, and Religious Studies (CNERS) [</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">University of British Columbia].&nbsp; An epigraphic  squeeze is a filter paper impression of an inscription, which provides a  precise copy of the incised letters on the original; this makes them a  valuable tool for research when students and scholars cannot access the  original materials stored in museums. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The McGregor Squeeze  Collection was donated by Dr. Malcolm McGregor, a former professor and  department chair in the CNERS Department.&nbsp; These squeezes mainly  represent inscriptions from Athens and the surrounding area of Attica  from the 5th century BCE, as well as some inscriptions from Nemea in the  same time period.&nbsp; The most notable squeezes held by the department  represent the Athenian Tribute Lists, which were the main focus of Dr.  McGregor’s work for many years.&nbsp; The originals of most of the squeezes  in the McGregor Squeeze Collection are held in the Epigraphic Museum in  Athens, Greece.&nbsp; The collection also includes epigraphic charts,  research tools which are drawings of reconstructions of the Athenian  Tribute Lists based on the stone fragments.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The digitization of  the McGregor Squeeze Collection is currently being carried out by  Digital Initiatives together with From Stone to Screen, a CNERS graduate  student-led initiative to digitize the department’s material  collections, and funded by a grant from UBC’s Teaching and Learning  Enhancement Fund.&nbsp; The process of digitizing these hundreds of squeezes  is on-going, so new images and information are added regularly.&nbsp; You can  read more about the ongoing status of the project on its blog:<a href="http://www.fromstonetoscreen.wordpress.com/"> www.fromstonetoscreen.wordpress.com</a>.</span></blockquote><br />]]></content>
