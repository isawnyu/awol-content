   <title type="text">A Bibliography of Semitic Linguistics (1940-2012)  By Gregorio del Olmo Lete</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.semiticbibliography.org/">A Bibliography of Semitic Linguistics (1940-2012)</a><br />Gregorio del Olmo Lete<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://www.aulaorientalis.org/semiticbibliography/images/buttons/head.gif" class="decoded" src="http://www.aulaorientalis.org/semiticbibliography/images/buttons/head.gif" /> </blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">It seems obligatory at the beginning of this bibliography to set out its  limits and justify its objectives. The aim of the bibliography is to  collect and arrange systematically only those studies directly or mainly  related to subjects of Semitic linguistics, namely, those centered on  the study of languages and their phonological, morphological, syntactic  and semantic constituents, from both the comparative perspective(close  and distant relationship) and the immanent perspective (grammar and  lexicon). Consequently, all other studies dealing with the history of  the societies which use or used those languages and with everything that  is built on them (socio-political history, literature, religion and  ‘culture’ in general), remain excluded. <br /><br /> This limitation may seem impossible or at the very least without  justification and minimalist, in some way resorting to ‘formalism’,  giving up the basic element, whose development a language has to  perform, namely, the shaping of a universe of social representations,  which generates a particular way of communication and creativity. One  could say that it means abandoning the ‘context’ in which every  linguistic formulation has its meaning, being at the same time its  outcome. But we cannot forget, in answer to such an objection, that our  purpose has a fixed point of support: it is constructed exclusively on  ‘texts’ as the products of language, which are the reference point for  testing and validating results. And if it is true that ‘the proposition  is the world’ (Wittgenstein), then linguistic analysis is the basis for  the understanding of any representation. <br /><br /> Our intention is to provide specialist information that arranges and  classifies as much as possible the vast amount of data constantly  presented by the general bibliography on Semitic languages and cultures.  In this way, access to such information will be made easier, with  better focus on the more important issues of research. At the same time  we intend to collect the information and classify it in a uniform  manner, in this way making it possible to compare across languages the  research being carried out within the various languages, since such  research often ignores other languages. <br /><br /> The first installment is devoted to general topics in respect of the  Semitic family as a whole. In this connexion, studies dealing with its  relationship to other linguistic groups and families (Nostratic, Hamitic  or Afro-Asiatic) will be taken into account in as much as they bear on  the study of Semitics proper. Here, Nostratic is taken in its wider  meaning, as used today among Indo-European scholars. In order to avoid  any prejudgements, in successive installments we will offer linguistic  bibliographies for each Semitic language as well as for each Semitic  language family according to its name, without attempting to decide on  its suitability or incorporate it within a particular preferred  classification. This is precisely one of the problems the present  bibliographical tool aims to address. The series will include the  following headings: [East and North Semitic], Akkadian, Eblaite,  Amorite, Ugaritic, [Northwest Semitic/Canaanite],Phoenician, Hebrew,  Aramaic/Syriac, South Semitic, Old (Epigraphic) North and South Arabian,  Modern South-Arabian, Arabic and Ethiopic, both classic and modern, the  pertinent dialectal variations being included under the appropriate  heading.The steady general bibliographical references are ordered, to  easy their use, according to titles instead of authors, which may vary  along the years. Otherwise, the alphabetic order according to author’s  name is followed. <br /> <br /> The cross-references to the individual bibliographies of each of these  languages and groups of languages are essential for extracting full  information on a specific linguistic issue at either a general or a  comparative level. In the first installment, any comparison of (at least  two) languages is noted. When the title specifies the language  compared, the item will be repeated in the corresponding bibliography  (“Comparative Level”). Unlike the other topics, where the aim is to be  exhaustive, the Bibliography on Semitic lexicography has been kept  within less strict limits, otherwise the task would have been endless. <br /><br /> Studies or references to particular lexemes have not been recorded in  the installment devoted to Common Semitics, unless they bear on  comparative issues. In principle, only treatments of ‘roots’ or  ‘semantic fields’ have been taken into account. Nevertheless, the  criterion has not always been applied stringently, since often it is  difficult to draw the line between particular and comparative  treatments. In the other installments, devoted to particular languages,  concrete lexemes also have been recorded, although in a non exhaustive  way. In any case, this section of the bibliography has to be taken as  merely indicative and perfunctory, and reference to up-to-date  lexicographic records is unavoidable. A thorough lexicographical entry  should even include reference to the main studies on editions and  commentaries on the texts, where the particular lexeme appears, but such  textual studies have not been included. As for book reviews, only the  most significant that appeared in the last years have been listed. <br /><br /> Barcelona, 04/17/2014</span> </blockquote><blockquote>                 <table
