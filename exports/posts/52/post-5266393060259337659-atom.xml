The  volume redirects attention from the Atlantic to the space of the eastern  Mediterranean shaped by two empires of remarkable duration and  territorial extent, the Byzantine and the Ottoman. The essays offer a  diachronic and comparative account that spans the medieval and early  modern periods and reaches into the nineteenth century. Methodologically  rich, the essays combine historical, literary, and theoretical  perspectives. Through texts as diverse as court records and chancery  manuals, imperial treatises and fictional works, travel literature and  theatrical adaptations, the essays explore ways in which the production  of geographical knowledge supported imperial authority or revealed its  precarious mastery of geography.</span><br /> <blockquote><div><span style="font-size: x-small;">“The dialectical relationship between empire and geography has long  been recognized. Empires are beneficiaries or prisoners of their  geography, while specific imperial projects have shaped the content and  effects of geographical knowledge across different periods. The essays  in this volume represent a collaboration between historians and literary  critics with intersecting interests in the imperial geographies of the  medieval and modern eastern Mediterranean. These geographies are set  within the extensive imperial and post-imperial space of the Byzantine  and Ottoman Empires, two political and cultural formations which  themselves contributed to perceptions of local and world geography.  Although the comparative study of empire has received much impetus in  recent years, it remains to a large extent focused on examples from the  classical world or the modern European era.&nbsp;This volume’s attention to  the space of the eastern Mediterranean centers instead on two empires  that do not fit this chronological scheme, and whose contribution to the  construction of imperial space has been relatively neglected, even  though in terms of duration and territorial extension they are both  remarkable.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: x-small;">The volume approaches geography, or rather the multiple geographies  of the area (the plural is necessitated by the divergent geographical  notions and experiences), as a socially constructed body of knowledge.  This means that the volume will largely leave aside problems of  Mediterranean environmental history and historical ecology that have  recently attracted considerable attention. Nor is cartography of central  concern to this volume, even though some of the papers engage with  questions of maps and mapping. The focus lies instead on the strategies,  ideological contexts, and effects of the production of geographical  knowledge, both material and imaginary. Through texts as diverse as  Ottoman&nbsp;<em>kadı&nbsp;</em>court records and chancery manuals, imperial  treatises on administration and works of fiction, travel literature, and  dramatic adaptations, the essays explore ways in which the production  of geographical knowledge supported imperial authority or revealed its  precarious mastery of geography. Our interest lies mainly in the  discursive construction of imperial space, and we bring to it a variety  of methodologies: historical and literary, textual and theoretical, but  in all cases explicitly ‘spatial’.”</span></div></blockquote><div><span style="font-size: x-small;">A printed copy of the work is <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674066625&amp;content=bios">available through Harvard University Press</a>.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="promo_scroll" class="aligncenter" height="5" src="http://chs.harvard.edu/wa/dImage?bdco=450&amp;bdc=12" title="promo_scroll" width="33" /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>Sahar Bazzaz</b>&nbsp;is Associate Professor of History at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.holycross.edu/departments/history/website/">College of the Holy Cross</a>.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>Yota Batsaki</b>&nbsp;is Executive Director of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.doaks.org/">Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection</a>.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>Dimiter Angelov</b>&nbsp;is Professor of Byzantine History at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/">University of Birmingham</a>.</span><br /> </div></blockquote><br /><div style="text-align: center;">And See AWOL's List of <a href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2010/09/open-access-publications-of-center-for.html" target="_blank">Open Access Publications of the Center for Hellenic Studies</a></div>]]></content>
