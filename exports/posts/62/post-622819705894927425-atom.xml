   <title type="text">Early Warnings: Digitized Chester Beatty papyri</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.csntm.com/">CHESTER BEATTY PAPYRI AT CSNTM!</a><br />Press Release<br />17 September 2013<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Chester Beatty papyri, published in the 1930s and 1950s, are <b>some of the oldest and most important biblical manuscripts known to exist.</b> Housed at the Chester Beatty Library (CBL) in Dublin, they have  attracted countless visitors every year. It is safe to say that the only  Greek biblical manuscripts that might receive more visitors are Codex  Sinaiticus and Codex Alexandrinus, both on display at the British  Library.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts (CSNTM) is  pleased to announce that a six-person team, in a four-week expedition  during July–August 2013, <b>digitized all the Greek biblical papyri at the Chester Beatty Library.</b> The CBL has granted permission to CSNTM to post the images on their <a href="http://www.csntm.org/">website</a> (www.csntm.org), which will happen before the end of the year.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://images.csntm.org/SiteImages/blogposts/chester_beatty_library.jpg"><img align="left" alt="Main Entrance to the Chester Beatty Library" border="1" height="261" src="http://images.csntm.org/SiteImages/blogposts/chester_beatty_library.jpg" style="border: 2px solid black; max-width: 100%;" width="400" /></a></span> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><b></b></span></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>The New Testament papyri at the CBL include the oldest manuscript  of Paul’s letters (dated c. AD 200), the oldest manuscript of Mark’s  Gospel and portions of the other Gospels and Acts (third century), and  the oldest manuscript of Revelation (third century).</b> One or two of the Old Testament papyri are as old as the second century AD. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Using state-of-the-art digital equipment, CSNTM photographed each  manuscript against white and black backgrounds. The result was stunning.  Each image is over 120 megabytes. The photographs reveal some text that  has not been seen before.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">   Besides the papyri, CSNTM also digitized all of the Greek New  Testament manuscripts at the CBL as well as several others, including  some early apocryphal texts. The total number of images came to more  than 5100.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">CSNTM is grateful to the CBL for the privilege of digitizing these  priceless treasures. Their staff were extremely competent and a joy to  work with. Kudos to Dr. Fionnuala Croke, Director of CBL, for such a  superb staff! This kind of collaboration is needed both for the  preservation of biblical manuscripts and their accessibility by  scholars.</span></blockquote>]]></content>
