   <title type="text">Euripides Scholia by Donald J. Mastronarde</title>

Some of the specific issues or goals are the following:</a></span></div><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" id="goals"><ul><li>Improve the accuracy and completeness of the information about the  most important manuscripts used in the standard edition of the old  scholia by Eduard Schwartz (1887-1891). From my sample to date covering <i>Orestes</i> 1-500, it is evident that Schwartz’s collations of M, B, and V were  quite accurate, but there are some corrections to be made; his collation  of C was less accurate and less complete. He also provided insufficient  information about the lemmata and he omitted some glosses (written by  the same hands as the scholia blocks). The scholia in H (the Jerusalem  palimpsest) were not known to him (the existence of H had been reported,  but because of the nature and condition of the manuscript nothing was  known of the scholia readings), and he did not report those in O, which  he wrongly considered to be of the 15th century, whereas currently  scholars date this manuscript to ca. 1175.</li><li>Clarify the extent, nature, and possible stemmatic relationships of  the scholia in some of the  so-called recentiores (manuscripts generally  dating from the very late 13th century and the 14th century and usually  confined to the plays of the Euripidean triad: <i>Hecuba</i>, <i>Orestes</i>, <i>Phoenissae</i>).  The editions of Matthiae and Dindorf reported some of these, while  Schwartz limits himself to rare reports, citing only readings that he  adopts from one of the recentiores when the older manuscripts he cites  all present a corruption or omit the relevant word(s). The relationship  of the scholia in these manuscripts to the those in the older  manuscripts needs to be fully explored. Many recentiores also carry  frequent glosses, and these cannot be accurately judged unless the  glosses in the older manuscripts are also collected completely. The  glosses in various recentiores also need to be known to provide context  for judging the younger scholia (scholia recentiora) by named scholars, a  very high proportion of which are glosses.</li><li>Provide a reliable and complete edition of the scholia attributable  to Manuel Moschopulus and Thomas Magister (both of whom were probably  commenting on the triad plays of Euripides roughly during the period  1290-1305). Moschopulean scholia are in general known from reports of Gr  in Dindorf’s edition, but Dindorf’s reporting of Gr is not complete and  Gr is in any case not the most reliable witness of this set of scholia.  Thoman scholia are partially known from reports of Gu in Dindorf’s  edition, but Dindorf’s reporting is even less complete for this set, and  Gu’s versions offer more variations and expansions than other witnesses  of the Thoman set.</li><li>Provide full reporting of Triclinius’ work on the triad in T  together with information about his much sparser metrical annotation in  L. Triclinius worked on this manuscript over a number of years in  roughly the period 1300-1325. The Triclinian scholia on the triad have  been published from T by De Faveri, but a few corrections can be  provided and a few omissions repaired (her edition is also hard to  obtain). For instance, only by comparison with an accurate collection of  Moschopulean and Thoman scholia can one recognize a few glosses and  notes that are unique to T (or to T and one or two other intriguing  witnesses). In addition, information about the colon-layout that  Triclinius’ metrical scholia describe can be provided to the user in a  more convenient fashion. The Triclinian notations in L on other plays  were partially reported in Matthiae’s edition, and are also treated by  Zuntz.</li><li>Incorporate into the corpus the few traces of marginal annotation that have been found in papyri and the scholia of P. Würzb. 1.</li><li>Clarify the nature and extent of scholia labeled as being by Maximus  Planudes or conjectured by some scholars to reflect his work.</li><li>Include, eventually, non-Triclinian metrical scholia.</li></ul></a></span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="navig2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://euripidesscholia.org/EurSchHome.html">Home</a> | <a href="http://euripidesscholia.org/EurSchGoals.html">Project Description</a> |<a href="http://euripidesscholia.org/EurSchMSS.html"> The Manuscripts</a> | <a href="http://euripidesscholia.org/EurSchStructure.html">The XML Structure</a> | <a href="http://euripidesscholia.org/EurSchAbbrev.html">Conventions &amp; Abbreviations</a> | <a href="http://euripidesscholia.org/EurSchBiblio.html">Bibliography</a> | <a href="http://euripidesscholia.org/EurSchFont.html">Greek Font</a> | <a href="http://euripidesscholia.org/EurSchLicense.html">License &amp; Source Files</a></span></div></blockquote><a href="http://euripidesscholia.org/EurSchLicense.html" target="_parent"></a><br /><div><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" id="data:post.url" name="data:post.title" onclick="return addthis_sendto()" onmouseout="addthis_close()" onmouseover="'return"></a><br /><script src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js?pub=xa-4a3fbb0e7571e986" type="text/javascript"></script></div>]]></content>
