   <title type="text">Reception of Antiquity in a Semantic Network: Digital Books, Images and Objects</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/drupal/?q=en/node/258">Reception of Antiquity in a Semantic Network: Digital Books, Images and Objects</a><br /><div class="content"> <blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The aim of the project is the reconstruction and online publication  of about 1700 prints, which appeared between 1500 and 1900. In a next  step forms of semantic networks are to be approached in separate  subprojects. This is to be illustrated through the direct  contextualisation of objects from Philipp von Stosch's Gem Collection.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The aim of the project "Reception of Antiquity in a Semantic Network"  within the Arachne database is the development and provision of  web-based prints from the period between 1500 and 1830. The project’s  basis is defined by engravings to classical, Near Eastern and Egyptian  Archaeology of the 16th till the 19th century from the library of the  Rome Department of the DAI. These early prints (e.g. travel, research  and excavation reports, catalogs) have been published in the examination  of the excavations and discoveries of ancient cultures in the  Mediterranean region.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />A total of 2,300 engravings will be processed.  Of these 1,200 (status  of July 2013) are digitized in a way, that they are available as  searchable full text (OCR). In addition, the in the engraving presented  objects are contextualized. This primarily concerns the structural  metadata of the prints as tables of contents, the presence of images or  captions, but also bibliographic data of the book. These are structured  in collaboration with the DAI’s ZENON database by using the TEI editor  which was developed for this purpose by the CoDArchLab. That is the  technical book division into cover, title page, table of contents, table  etc. which is tagged by using the TEI editor’s user interface, so links  are created in a standardized way.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />Among the semantic metadata the objects pictured and described in the  prints, and also its places and people are primarily relevant. This  information will be identified and linked to the corresponding  information in the image and object database Arachne, i.e. on the one  hand to "real" objects and also to the relevant collection, topography  and reception records. If this information is not yet available in  Arachne, the corresponding records are created.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />Looking up the Stoss'schen gem collection you find the contextualizing  of the semantic metadata deepened. The digitized titles will also be  found on the Metasearch of the Virtual Library "PropylaeumSEARCH2".</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The four and a half year project "Reception of Antiquity in a  Semantic Network" began in September 2009 and is funded by the DFG.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />The following institutions are involved: Rome Departement of the DAI,  the head office of the DAI in Berlin, the CoDArchLab in Cologne, ZENON  database and the Winckelmann-Gesellschaft Stendal.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The expected findings of the overall project concerning former  storage places, collection history and publication of archaeological  history until the end of the 19th century will offer many insights to  the prospective research into the change of the antiques understanding  during the Baroque, Enlightenment and Classicism. Thus, the project  provides insights into the history of archeology, in the reception of  antiquity of various epochs, in the history of various collections and  the development of archaeological publications. Ultimately, the project  contributes to the interdisciplinary and cultural historical research.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.propylaeum.de/classical-archaeology/thematic-portals/rezeptionderantike/project-description.html?L=1" target="_blank">Further Information</a></span><br /> </blockquote></div><blockquote><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/arachne/index.php?view%5Blayout%5D=search_result_category&amp;view%5Bcategory%5D=buch&amp;search%5Bconstraints%5D%5Bbuch%5D%5BArbeitsnotizBuch%5D=semantique">All books of the project "Reception of Antiquity in a Semantic Network"</a> </span></blockquote>]]></content>
