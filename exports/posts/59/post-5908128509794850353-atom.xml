   <title type="text">Emerging Project: Thinking Through Thucydides</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/thucydides/ttt/">Thinking Through Thucydides (T3)</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The ancient Greek historian Thucydides famously claimed that his work  would be ‘a possession for all time’: not just the history of a single  war between the Athenians and the Spartans, but a guide to the way that  the world works, and especially to politics and war.&nbsp; He was right. Over  the last two hundred years, Thucydides has been one of the most  frequently quoted ancient writers. His ideas have influenced historians,  politicians, international relations experts and soldiers; all agree  that his work is useful and important.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Thucydides does not offer simple lessons, but a training course in  analysis and deliberation. He demands that his readers follow his  narrative of events and think about how things could have turned out  differently; he asks them to listen to opposing arguments and to weigh  up the issues – and then to think about how those arguments relate what  actually happened.&nbsp; He shows how the world is complicated – and how we  can make sense of that complexity. In brief, he aims to help his readers  to develop the skills that every citizen of a democracy needs.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The lessons that Thucydides offers are needed today more than ever.  The problem is that his work is complex and difficult, even in the  original Greek – and of course most readers have to rely on  translations, often of dubious quality. The aim of the <b>T3</b> project (<i>Thinking Through Thucydides</i>, or <i>Thinking, Through Thucydides</i>)  is to make key passages from Thucydides' work accessible to as many  people as possible, setting his words in context and explaining  significant points. These passages can then serve as a resource for  thinking about the world and our place in it, a starting-point for  debate about some of the most vital issues that face us today.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The project is at a very early stage of development; on this webpage  you will find one sample passage of Thucydides (II.43, from the Funeral  Oration) along with contextual material and key questions to discuss, to  show you what we have in mind. We plan to develop this resource in  partnership with schools, so that it can serve as a resource for the  study of both Classical Civilisation and Citizenship, but we hope that  this will be of interest to everyone. In due course we will be  introducing a blog where you can post your comments and suggestions, and  get involved in debates about the significance of passages; in the  meantime, if you have any comments, or if you would like to be involved  in developing this project, please contact Neville Morley  (n.d.g.morley(at)bris.ac.uk).</span><br /><ul class="navgroup"><li class="public">                            <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/thucydides/project/">    <span style="font-size: xx-small;">About the Project                                                              </span></a>                                                             </li><li class="public">                            <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/thucydides/people/">    Members of the Project                                                              </a></span>                                                             </li><li class="public">                            <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/thucydides/events/">    Workshops and Other Events                                                              </a></span>                                                             </li><li class="public">                            <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/thucydides/publications/">    Publications                                                              </a></span>                                                             </li><li class="public">                            <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/thucydides/links/">    Links                                                              </a></span>                                                             </li><li class="public">                            <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/thucydides/conference/">    Thucydides our Contemporary Conference                                                              </a></span>                                                             </li><li class="public">                                                         <span class="link-on" style="font-size: xx-small;">    Thinking Through Thucydides                                                </span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <ul><li class="public">                            <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/thucydides/ttt/text/">    II.43: Text and Translation                                                              </a></span>                                                             </li><li class="public">                            <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/thucydides/ttt/context/">    II.43: Context and Meaning                                                              </a></span>                                                             </li><li class="public">                            <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/thucydides/ttt/issues/">    II.43: Reception &amp; Key Issues                                                              </a></span>                                                             </li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><br /><br /><br />]]></content>
