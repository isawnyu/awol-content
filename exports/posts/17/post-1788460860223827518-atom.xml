In the following you will get some short information about the project.</span><br /><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">The Chinese Archaeology Database (CHARDA-Xplore) began as part of the research project <a href="http://www.dainst.org/index_78d8b86cbb1f14a163990017f0000011_de.html" target="_blank">'Chinese Metal' (CHIME), located in the research-cluster 2 of the DAI</a>, and was originally designed to collect and document the available information on early Chinese metal finds.</span><br /><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">CHARDA-Xplore basically serves as a collection of standardized and geo-referenced archaeological information, providing the possibility to analyze these data statistically and to map spatial and temporal distribution patterns.</span><br /><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">Only three basic parameters are necessary for creating a site entry:  site name, from which a site-ID will be created, geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) and date of the site, finds/objects  or a sub-site.</span><br /><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">By the use of a link to Google Earth satellite imagery the database  provides mapping of sites in connection of its date. This way of representation is extremely suitable to visualise the migration of  find-properties in space and time.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">As Google Earth maps the complete Earth's surface the scheme of the  database CHARDA-Xplore is also in the way applied, that it can capture archaeological data of any region in the world. Deciding and  differentiating are only the catalogs, that is concept-lists to classify the properties of finds. The created and deposited catalogs contain up to now german and in the  future also english and chinese terms for describing common archaeological circumstances as well as finds of neolithic- and  metal-periods in east- and central-asia.&nbsp;</span><br /><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">The easy way of including images, adds to the database simultaneously  the character of a systematic and extensive itemized image-archive.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">We decided to create the input- and query-tool with optical structures  that are well known to an average computer user. CHARDA-Xplore contains a tree-view at the left side that is known from the  windows-explorer to navigate through the information in the database and also a query-field that is the same such at every famous  internet-search-engine. The catalogs are created as abstract as possible  but at the same time as specific as needed. To grant the database a maximum  lifetime of using as a datastorage and researchtool through users with different educational background in computer-technology and to  grant it a highly practicable way of data-input and -query, the database is self-explanatory, extensible and easy to connect to other databases.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">To use this functionality of CHARDA-Xplore you have to <a href="http://charda-xplore.dainst.org/index.php/en/register">register</a> only once.  </span></blockquote><br /><br />]]></content>
